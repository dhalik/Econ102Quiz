3) According to tax receipt and outlay categories, what are the main components of the federal
government budget?
Answer: The budget is divided between the tax receipt side and the outlay side. On the taxation
side, the largest components are personal income taxes and social security taxes. Between
them they account for over 80 percent of total government tax receipts. The remainder of
tax revenue comes from corporate income taxes and indirect taxes, such as taxes on items
such as gasoline. On the outlay side, the major three categories are transfer payments, the
expenditure on goods and service, and interest payments on the government debt. The
first category is the largest and continues to grow, accounting for well over half of all
payments. These include payments to individuals, businesses, other levels of
government, and governments around the world. These payments come in the form of
Social Security benefits, unemployment payments, and subsidies, grants and loans to
farmers, local and state governments and foreign governments. The last category, debt
interest, is the smallest and even fell during the late 2000s because the interest rate was
low.

4) Depending on the relative size of the federal governmentʹs outlays and tax receipts, the federal
governmentʹs budget can be in three possible conditions. What are the three possible conditions
and what is the relationship of federal government outlays and tax receipts for each?
Answer: The federal governmentʹs budget could have a budget surplus, a budget deficit, or a
balanced budget. A budget surplus occurs when tax receipts are greater than government
outlays; a deficit occurs when tax receipts are less than government outlays; and a
balanced budget occurs when tax receipts are equal to government outlays.

5) What is the difference between budget surplus, budget deficit and a balanced budget? Which of
these three budget outcomes is currently the case in the United States?
Answer: A budget surplus occurs if tax revenues exceed outlays; a budget deficit occurs if tax
revenues are less than outlays; and a balanced budget occurs if tax revenues equal
outlays. Currently the United States is running a budget deficit.

7) How has the federal government debt as a percentage of GDP changed since the end of World
War II?
Answer: As a percentage of GDP, the federal government debt hit its high at the end of World War
II when it was about 120 percent of GDP. The percentage then fell steadily into the 1970s.
The large deficits of the 1980s raised the percentage during the 1980s and into the 1990s.
From 1995 to 2001, the percentage feel but since then has risen, rapidly in the last few
years.

8) How does a tax on labor income affect potential GDP?
Answer: The income tax reduces the incentive to work by driving a wedge between gross and net
income. The tax shifts the supply of labor curve leftward and decreases the supply of
labor as workers decide to work fewer hours. The decrease in the supply of labor
decreases the equilibrium level of employment, which decreases potential GDP.

9) What is the Laffer curve? Where on their Laffer curves are the United States, the United
Kingdom and France located?
Answer: The Laffer curve is graphed with tax revenue on the y-axis and tax rates on the x-axis.
The Laffer curve captures the concept that raising the tax rate eventually leads to lower
tax revenues being collected. At low tax rates, an increase in the tax rate raises the total
tax revenue collected. But if government raises the tax rate high enough, an increase in
the tax rate leads to lowers the total tax revenue collected. This effect takes place because
when the tax rate is high enough, the disincentive effect of the tax becomes so large that
enough people give up working and saving so that the total tax revenue declines. While
most economists believe the United States is on the upward sloping part of its Laffer
curve, so that an increase in the tax rate raises total tax revenue. The United Kingdom is
believed to be also on the upward sloping part of its Laffer curve. But France might be at
the peak of its curve or even on the downward sloping part, where an increase in the tax
rate lowers total tax revenue.

10) If the government raises taxes on labor income and interest income, explain how potential GDP
and economic growth are affected.
Answer: Tax increases on labor income decrease the supply of labor and so decrease equilibrium
employment, which decreases potential GDP. Tax increases on the income from capital
decrease saving and so decrease the supply of capital, which decreases equilibrium
investment and capital and so decreases economic growth.

11) What is the difference between discretionary fiscal policy and automatic fiscal policy?
Answer: Discretionary fiscal policy is a policy action initiated by an act of Congress. Automatic
fiscal policy are mechanisms that help stabilize GDP and operate without the need for
explicit action. Both taxes (such as income taxes, whose receipts rise when the economy
expands and fall when the economy contracts) and needs-tested spending (such as
welfare spending, which decreases when the economy expands and increases when the
economy contracts) are examples of automatic fiscal policy.

12) What is automatic fiscal policy? How does it affect the budget deficit and/or budget surplus
during a recession and during an expansion?
Answer: Automatic fiscal policy are features of fiscal policy that stabilize real GDP without the
need for explicit policy action by the government. Automatic fiscal policy includes
automatic changes in taxes and needs-tested spending. The government often sets tax
rates rather than a total dollar amount of taxes. During a recession, taxes receipts
automatically decrease and needs-tested spending increases, so the budget deficit
increases (or the budget surplus decreases). During an expansion, tax receipts
automatically increase and means-tested spending decreases, so the budget deficit
decreases (or the budget surplus increases).

13) What is the government expenditure multiplier?
Answer: The government expenditure multiplier is the magnification effect of a change in
government expenditure on aggregate demand. It exists because an increase in
government expenditure increases aggregate and thereby increases real GDP. In turn the
increase in real GDP induces increases in consumption expenditure which future increase
aggregate expenditure and real GDP. So the ultimate increase in aggregate demand
exceeds the initiating increase in government expenditure.

14) What is needs-tested spending and how does it affect the government expenditure multiplier?
Answer: Needs-tested spending is government spending that changes when GDP changes.
Unemployment compensation payments is an example: They decrease when the
economy expands and increase when the economy contracts. Needs-tested spending
decreases the magnitude of the government expenditure multiplier. For instance, when
government expenditure increases, peopleʹs disposable income increases but
needs-tested spending thereby decreases. The decrease in needs-tested spending offsets
some of the initial increase in disposable income, thereby decreasing the multiplier.

15) Ignoring any supply-side effects, how does the magnitude of the government expenditure
multiplier compare to the magnitude of the tax multiplier? Explain your answer.
Answer: The magnitude of the government expenditure multiplier is larger than the magnitude of
the tax multiplier. The government expenditure multiplier is larger because a $1 change
in government expenditure has an initial effect on aggregate demand of $1. In other
words, a $1 increase in government expenditure initially increases aggregate demand by
the entire $1. However, a $1 change in taxes does  not initially affect aggregate demand by
the entire $1. Instead, it affects aggregate demand by less than $1. For instance, a $1
decrease in taxes increases aggregate demand by less than $1. Why? Because part of the
$1 decrease in taxes is saved and the amount saved does not increase aggregate demand.

20) What are some of the limitations of fiscal policy? Briefly discuss them.
Answer: One limitation of fiscal policy is the fact that implementing fiscal policy is slow and so it
is difficult to have the proper policy in place. Another limitation is that at times it is
difficult to determine if GDP is less than, equal to, or greater than potential GDP. As a
result, it is difficult to determine if fiscal policy should be expansionary or contractionary.

Answer: A recessionary gap occurs when real GDP is less than potential GDP, which is precisely
what the figure illustrates. In the figure, potential GDP equals $13 trillion but real GDP
equals only $12.5 trillion. In order to restore real GDP back to potential GDP using fiscal
policy, the government could increase government expenditure on goods and services

what happens to the demand for labor? What happens to the supply of labor? Explain.
e) After the tax is imposed, what happens to Prescottiaʹs full-employment quantity of labor?
What happens to Prescottiaʹs potential GDP?
Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education, Inc.456   Parkin · Macroeconomics, Tenth Edition
Answer:
a)
See the figure above.
b) See the figure above. Prescottiaʹs demand for labor curve is LD and the supply of
labor curve is LS.
c) As shown in the second figure, the labor market is in equilibrium when the quantity
of labor employed is 280 million hours and the real wage rate is $16 per hour. So the
economyʹs full-employment quantity of labor is 280 million hours at a real wage rate of
$16 per hour. Potential GDP is the level of real GDP at full employment. The production
function in the first figure shows that if 280 million hours of labor are employed, the
countryʹs real GDP is $8,400 million. So the economyʹs potential GDP is $8.4 billion.
d) The income tax has no effect on the demand for labor because the quantity of labor
that firms plan to hire depends only on how productive labor is and what it costsits real
wage. But the tax weakens the incentive to work and decreases the supply of labor. When
Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education, Inc.Chapter 13   Fiscal Policy   457
the income tax is imposed, workers look at the after -tax wage rate and, to supply the
same quantity of labor as with no tax, they demand a before-tax wage rate that is 25
percent higher than before. So the supply of labor decreases and the supply of labor curve
shifts from LS to LS T.
e) As shown in the second figure illustrating the labor market, with the tax Prescottiaʹs
full-employment quantity of labor decreases from 280 to 270 million hours per year. And
the production function shown in the first figure illustrates that as the full-employment
quantity of labor decreases from 280 to 270 million hours per year, the economyʹs
potential GDP falls from $8,400 million to (approximately) $8,235 million.
