Answer:  The formula showing how households can divide their income is Y = C + S = T, where Y is income, C is consumption expenditure and T is taxes. According to the expenditure approach income, GDP = C + I + G + X – M. But income, Y, equals GDP. So, setting the equalities equal to one another and removing C since it is on both sides gives I + G + X – M = S + T. Moving G, X and M to the right hand side gives the final result: I = S + (T – G) + (M – X). Here we see that investment is financed by private saving, S, government saving, (T – G), and borrowing from the rest of the world, (M – X).

Answer:  The real interest rate equals the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. Topic:  The Real Interest Rate Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 7 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  3) What is the influence of the expected profit and the real interest rate on the amount of investment firms make? Answer:  Firms make a decision about whether to undertake an investment based upon the benefit of the investment, the expected profit, versus the opportunity cost of making the investment, the real interest rate. For any particular investment firms compare the expected profit to the real interest rate. If the expected profit exceeds the real interest rate the firm will undertake the investment. If the expected profit is less than the real interest rate the firm will not undertake the investment. Topic:  Investment Decisions Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 7 AACSB:  Communication 4) "An increase in the real interest rate increases the quantity of investment." Is the previous statement correct or incorrect? Answer:  The statement is false. The interest rate is the opportunity cost of the funds used to make an investment. Hence an increase in the interest rate decreases the quantity of investment demanded. Topic:  The Real Interest Rate and Investment Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 7 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  5) Explain the relationship between the real interest rate and the demand for loanable funds. Compare that relationship to the relationship between expected profit and the demand for loanable funds. Answer:  The real interest rate determines the quantity of loanable funds demanded. There is an inverse relationship between the real interest rate and the quantity of loanable funds demanded. Expected profit affects investment and, because investment is a major source of the demand for loanable funds, te expected profit rate affects the demand for loanable funds. An increase in the expected profit from investing increases investment and thereby increases the demand for loanable funds. Hence there is a positive relationship between the demand for loanable funds and the expected profit rate.

66 Copyright © 2012 Pearsn Education 6) How does an increase in the expected profit affect investment demand and the demand for loanable funds curve? Answer:  An increase in the expected profit increases investment. Because investment demand is a large part of the demand for loanable funds, an increase in the expected profit shifts the demand for loanable funds curve rightward. Topic:  Expected Profit Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 7 AACSB:  Analytical Skills  7) What are the factors that change investment demand and shift the demand for loanable funds curve? Answer:  Investment demand changes with the changes in the expected profit. The expected profit depends on technological change. Investment increases and so the demand for loanable funds curve shifts rightward when technology advances. Topic:  Investment Demand Curve Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 7 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking 8) How does the real interest affect households' decisions about saving? Answer:  All disposable income is either used for consumption or saving. The opportunity cost of consumption is the amount of foregone interest you could earn if you saved. The return to saving is the real interest rate, so the higher the real interest rate, the greater the opportunity cost of consuming and not saving. As a result, an increase in the real interest rate leads to an increase in the quantity households save. Topic:  Saving Decisions Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 7 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  9) How does expected future income affect saving supply? Answer:  Expected future income affects saving supply because the lower a household's expected future income, the greater is its (current) saving supply.

67 Copyright © 2012 Pearsn Education 10) What is the relationship between the real interest rate, the supply of loanable funds and the demand for loanable funds? Answer:  The supply of loanable funds has a positive relationship between the real interest rate and the quantity of loanable funds supplied. In a figure, a supply of loanable funds curve has a positive slope. Similarly, the demand for loanable funds is the relationship between the real interest rate and the amount of loanable funds demanded. In a figure, a demand for loanable funds curve has a negative slope. Topic:  Determining the Real Interest Rate Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 7 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  11) Does a change in the real interest rate shift the supply of loanable funds curve? Explain your answer. Answer:  A change in the real interest rate does not shift the supply of loanable funds curve. Instead, the change in the real interest rate results in a change in the quantity of loanable funds supplied and a movement along the supply of loanable funds curve. The supply of loanable funds curve shifts if some factor that influences the supply of loanable funds other than the real interest rate changes. Topic:  Supply of Loanable Funds Curve Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 7 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking 12) What are the factors that change the supply of saving and shift the supply of loanable funds curve? Answer:  There are three main factors that influence saving: disposable income, wealth, expected future disposable income, and default risk. The higher disposable income, the more people save, so an increase in disposable income shifts the supply of loanable funds curve rightward. The higher people's wealth, the less they save because they feel richer and do not see the need to save. Thus an increase wealth shifts the supply of loanable funds curve leftward. The higher the expected future disposable income, the less people save today. Thus an increase in the expected future disposable income shifts the supply of loanable funds curve leftward. Finally the higher the default risk, the less people save and so the supply of loanable funds curve shifts leftward.

68 Copyright © 2012 Pearsn Education 13) Explain how each of the following events affect the supply of loanable funds curve: a) The economy is in a recession so people's disposable income is lower. b) The stock market is booming so the people's wealth is higher. c) Fewer college graduates are finding jobs so expected future income is lower. d) The real interest rate increases. Answer:   a) Disposable income is lower, so saving is decreased. The supply of loanable funds curve shifts leftward. b) People are wealthier, so they save less. The supply of loanable funds curve shifts leftward. c) Expected future income is lower, so people save more. The supply of loanable funds curve shifts rightward. d) The quantity of saving increases. There is an upward movement along the supply of loanable funds curve but no shift in the curve. Topic:  Supply of Loanable Funds Curve Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 7 AACSB:  Communication  14) "When there is a shortage of loanable funds, the real interest rate will increase." Explain whether the previous statement is correct or not. Answer:  The statement is correct. The shortage of loanable funds means that there are firms and others attempting to obtain loans who cannot do so. As a result, the real interest rate rises until equilibrium is attained. Topic:  Determining the Real Interest Rate Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 7 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking 15) In the loanable funds market, what variable changes to eliminate a shortage of loanable funds and how is the shortage eliminated? Answer:  The real interest rate changes to eliminate the shortage of loanable funds. A shortage of loanable funds means that businesses and others want to borrow more than households and others are willing to loan so that the quantity of loanable funds demanded exceeds the quantity of loanable funds supplied. This shortage means that some businesses are willing to pay a higher interest rate. The real interest rate rises, and as it does so, the quantity of loanable funds demanded decreases and the quantity of loanable funds supplied increases. Both changes help eliminate the shortage of loanable funds and so the real interest rate rises until it reaches its equilibrium value.

 1) The table above shows the loanable funds supply and demand schedules. a) What is the equilibrium real interest rate and the equilibrium quantity of loanable funds? b) If the real interest rate is 4 percent, is there a shortage or surplus? What will happen in the market? Answer:   a) The equilibrium real interest rate is 6 percent and the equilibrium quantity of loanable funds is $1.1 trillion. b) If the real interest rate is 4 percent, there is a shortage of loanable funds. The shortage means that the quantity of funds demanded for investment exceeds the quantity supplied, so the real interest rate will rise to its equilibrium of 6 percent.

 1) The economy of Dream Island, which is isolated from the rest of the world, has the supply of loanable funds schedule and the demand for loanable funds schedule shown in the table above. As it happens, all of the supply of loanable funds are from households' saving and the entre demand for loanable funds is from firms' investment demand. a) Draw the demand and supply curves. b) What is the equilibrium real interest rate? c) What is equilibrium investment? Equilibrium saving? d) Describe the situation in Dream Island's loanable funds market when the real interest rate is 10 percent. Is there a shortage of loanable funds? A surplus of loanable funds? e) Describe the situation in Dream Island's capital market when the real interest rate is 6 percent. Is there a shortage of loanable funds? A surplus of loanable funds? Answer:   

  a) See the figure above. b) The equilibrium real interest rate is the interest rate at which the quantity of loanable funds demanded (which is the quantity of investment demanded) equals the quantity of loanable funds supplied (which is the quantity of saving supplied). As the figure shows, in the economy of Dream Island, the equilibrium real interest rate is 8 percent. 




72 Copyright © 2012 Pearsn Education c) The equilibrium amount of investment equals 3,500 dollars. The equilibrium amount of saving is the same, $3,500. d) When the real interest rate is 10 percent, the quantity of loanable funds supplied(which is the quantity of saving supplied), $4,500, exceeds the quantity of loanable funds demanded (which is the quantity of investment demanded), $2,500. So there a surplus of loanable funds. Borrowers have an easy time finding the loans they want, but lenders are unable to lend all the funds they have available. As a result, the real interest rate falls until the quantity of loanable funds supplied equals the quantity of loanable funds demanded. e) When the real interest rate is 6 percent, the quantity of loanable funds supplied (which is the quantity of saving supplied) $2,500, is less than the quantity of loanable funds demanded (which is the quantity of investment demanded), $4,500. There is a shortage of loanable funds. Borrowers can't find the loans they want, but lenders are able to lend all the funds they have available. As a result, the real interest rate rises until the quantity of loanable funds supplied equals the quantity of loanable funds demanded.
