6  Essay Questions
1) In the aggregate demand-aggregate supply framework, how does an increase in the price level
affect potential GDP?
Answer: An increase in the price level has no effect on potential GDP. Potential GDP is
independent of the price level, so increases or decreases in the price level have no effect
on potential GDP.

2) How are potential GDP, full employment and the LAS curve related?
Answer: When the economy is at full employment there is no cyclical unemployment and the
economy is at its potential level of real GDP. The LAS curve is vertical at the level of
potential real GDP.

3) Give examples of factors that decrease short-run aggregate supply. Which way does the SAS
curve shift?
Answer: Aggregate supply decreases if potential GDP decreases. In addition, cost hikes such as a
rise in the money wage rate or the price of oil, decreases short -run aggregate supply.
Whenever short-run aggregate supply decreases, the SAS curve shifts leftward.

4) What is the difference between the long-run aggregate supply and the short-run aggregate
supply curves?
Answer: The long-run aggregate supply curve, LAS, is the relationship between the price level
and real GDP when real GDP equals potential GDP. The LAS curve is vertical. Along the
LAS curve, both the prices of goods and services and the prices of resources, such as the
money wage rate, change. The short-run aggregate supply curve, SAS, is the relationship
between the price level and the quantity of real GDP supplied in the short run when the
money wage rate and other resource prices are constant. The SAS curve slopes upward.
Along the SAS curve, only the price level changes; the money wage rate and other
resource prices are constant. The SAS curve shifts leftward when the money wage rate (or
other costs) rise.

5) How do changes in the money wage rate affect the LAS and SAS curves? Explain your answer.
Answer: If the money wage rate changes, the  LAS curve is not affected but the SAS curve shifts.
For instance, if the money wage rate rises, the LAS curve does not change but the SAS
curve shifts leftward. The difference occurs because moving along the LAS curve both the
money wage rate and price level change in the same proportion. So in this case, a change
in the money wage rate is matched by a change in the price level and firms have no
incentive to change their production of goods and services. But moving along the  SAS
curve, only the price level changes. So when the money wage rate changes and the price
level does not change, firms have an incentive to change their production. For instance, if
the money wage rate rises and the price level does not change, then firms decrease their
production of goods and services and the SAS curve shifts leftward.

6) What are the factors that can shift the short-run aggregate supply curve but not the long-run
aggregate supply curve? Explain your answer.
Answer: The only factor that shifts the short-run aggregate supply curve but not the long-run
aggregate supply curve is a change in the money wage rate or the money prices of other
resources. For instance, an increase in the money wage rate shifts the  SAS curve leftward,
but does not shift the LAS curve.

7) Explain the reasons why the AD curve slopes downward.
Answer: There are two reasons why the AD curve slopes downward: the wealth effect and
substitution effects.
The wealth effect points out how changes in the price level cause changes in the real
value of wealth. Price increases decrease real wealth and so people consume less in order
to increase their wealth through saving. As a result, an increase in the price level
decreases the aggregate quantity of goods and services demanded.
There are two substitution effects. The first is the intertemporal substitution effect: an
increase in the price level raises the interest rate because the amount of real loans banks
can make decreases. The higher interest rate leads consumers to decrease their
consumption expenditure and firms to decrease their investment spending. The second
substitution effect is the international price substitution effect: an increase in the U.S.
price level raises the price of U.S.-made goods relative to foreign-made goods. So people
and firms decrease the quantity of U.S.-made goods they purchase and increase the
quantity of foreign-made goods they purchase. So both substitution effects also lead to a
rise in the price level decreasing the aggregate quantity demanded.

8) What is the effect on the aggregate demand curve from an increase in the price level? In
particular, does the aggregate demand curve shift leftward or rightward?
Answer: When the price level increases, there is a movement along the aggregate demand curve.
The quantity of real GDP demanded decreases in response to an increase in the price
level. However, the aggregate demand curve does  not shift. Factors that change aggregate
demand and shift the aggregate demand curve are changes in the interest rate, in the
quantity of money, in government expenditure, in taxes, in the exchange rate, and in real
GDP in the rest of the world.

9) What are the substitution effects that affect aggregate demand?
Answer: There are two substitution effects that affect aggregate demand and help account for the
negative slope of the AD curve. First, an increase in the price level raises the interest rate,
which reduces the quantity of real GDP demanded. Second, an increase in the U.S. price
level raises the price of U.S. goods relative to foreign goods which also decreases the
quantity of U.S. real GDP demanded.

Answer: Anything that decreases aggregate spending decreases aggregate demand. A rise in the

all decrease aggregate demand. The aggregate demand curve shifts leftward.

12) What are fiscal and monetary policies? Do they have an immediate effect on the  AD curve or the

Answer: Fiscal policy is defined as changes in government spending and taxation to affect the
level of economic activity. Monetary policy consists of changing interest rates and
changing the quantity of money in the economy in order to affect the level of economic
activity. Both policies have an impact on the AD curve.

13) What are the components of fiscal policy? Explain how fiscal policy affects aggregate demand.
Answer: Fiscal policy affects aggregate demand through government expenditure, transfer
payments and taxes. Because government purchases are a component of total spending, a
change in government expenditure directly changes aggregate demand. A change in
transfer payments changes disposable income which, in turn, changes consumption
expenditure and aggregate demand. Finally, taxes alter disposable income and thus
impact consumption expenditure and aggregate demand.

15) What two variables are determined in an aggregate supply-aggregate demand figure? Is the
slope of the short-run aggregate supply curve positive or negative? Is the slope of the aggregate
demand curve positive or negative?
Answer: The aggregate supply-aggregate demand framework determines the equilibrium price
level and equilibrium real GDP. The aggregate supply curve is positively sloped,
indicating that an increase in the price level increases the aggregate quantity of goods and
services supplied. The aggregate demand curve is negatively sloped, indicating that an
increase in the price level decreases the aggregate quantity of goods and services
demanded.

16) Explain the relationship of the long-run aggregate supply curve, the short-run aggregate
supply curve and the aggregate demand curve in determining a long -run and short-run
macroeconomic equilibrium.
Answer: Short-run macroeconomic equilibrium occurs when the quantity of GDP demanded
equals the quantity supplied, which is where the AD and SAS curves intersect. The
short-run equilibrium does not necessarily take place at full employment. The long-run
macroeconomic equilibrium occurs when real GDP equals potential GDP. This means
that the economy is on the LAS curve, where the AD and SAS curves both intersect the
LAS curve.

20) What happens if the economy is at its long-run equilibrium and aggregate demand increases?
Answer: The increase in aggregate demand means that the AD curve shifts rightward. Initially
short-run aggregate supply does not change, so the  SAS curve remains stationary. As a
result, the price level rises and real GDP increases. The economy is an above
full-employment equilibrium. Eventually, however, the tight labor market leads to a rise
in the money wage rate. When the money wage rate rises, short-run aggregate supply
decreases and the SAS curve shifts leftward. The price level rises and real GDP decreases.
In the long run, the short-run aggregate supply decreases so that real GDP returns to
potential level of GDP and the only effect is that the price level is permanently higher.

21) If the world economy expands so that foreign demand for U.S.-made goods increases, in the
short run what will happen to aggregate demand, the price level, and real GDP in the U.S.?
Answer: Net exports increase so U.S. aggregate demand increases. The U.S. price level and real
GDP both increase.

22) Compare the policy prescriptions of Keynesian, Classical, and Monetarist economists.
Answer: Keynesians believe that without assistance the economy would almost never be at full
employment. They prescribe activist fiscal and monetary policy to drive the economy to
full employment. Classical economists believe the economy is self-regulating and will
always tend towards full employment. Their main policy initiatives center on removing
tax created disincentives for growth. Monetarists call for low taxes and consistent money
growth because Monetarists believe that recessions are the result of fluctuations in the
quantity of money.

1) The table above shows Purplelandʹs economy aggregate demand and supply schedules.
Purplelandʹs potential GDP is $675 billion.
a) Plot the aggregate demand curve, the short-run aggregate supply curve, and the long-run
aggregate supply curve.
b) What are the short-run equilibrium real GDP and price level in Purpleland?
c) What is the long-run equilibrium real GDP?
d) Is Purplelandʹs short-run macroeconomic equilibrium a full-employment equilibrium,
below full-employment equilibrium, or above full-employment equilibrium? What is the
recessionary gap (if any)? What is the inflationary gap (if any)?
e) Suppose aggregate demand increases by $150 billion. Plot the new aggregate demand
curve. How do real GDP and the price level change in the short run?
f) Is Purplelandʹs new short-run macroeconomic equilibrium a full-employment equilibrium,
below full-employment equilibrium, or above full-employment equilibrium? What is the
recessionary gap (if any)? What is the inflationary gap (if any)?
Answer:
a)
See the figure above. The aggregate demand curve is AD 0 .
Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education, Inc.Chapter 10   Aggregate Supply and Aggregate Demand   129
b) A short-run macroeconomic equilibrium occurs where the aggregate demand curve,
AD 0 , intersects the short-run aggregate supply curve, SAS. As the figure shows, the
short-run equilibrium real GDP is $600 billion, and the short-run equilibrium price level
is 100.
c) Long-run equilibrium real GDP equals potential GDP. So the long-run equilibrium
real GDP in Purpleland is $675 billion.
d) Purplelandʹs short-run macroeconomic equilibrium is a below full-employment
equilibrium because the short-run equilibrium GDP is less than potential GDP. The
amount by which potential GDP exceeds real GDP is a recessionary gap, so the
recessionary gap is $75 billion. An inflationary gap exists when real GDP is above
potential GDP, so there is no inflationary gap in Purpleland.
e) As the figure above shows, the aggregate demand curve shifts from  AD 0  to AD 1 . As
a result, real GDP increases from $600 billion to $675 billion, and the price level rises from
100 to 110.
f) Purplelandʹs new short-run macroeconomic equilibrium is a full-employment
equilibrium because the equilibrium real GDP equals the potential GDP. When real GDP
equals potential GDP, there is neither a recessionary gap nor an inflationary gap.

a) Plot the aggregate demand curve, the short-run aggregate supply curve, and the long-run
aggregate supply curve.
b) What are the short-run equilibrium real GDP and price level in Yellowland?
c) What is the long-run equilibrium real GDP?
d) Is Yellowlandʹs short-run macroeconomic equilibrium a full-employment equilibrium,
below full-employment equilibrium, or above full-employment equilibrium? What is the
recessionary gap (if any)? What is the inflationary gap (if any)?
e) Suppose aggregate supply decreases by $150 billion. Plot the new aggregate supply curve.
How do real GDP and the price level change in the short run?
f) Is Yellowlandʹs new short-run macroeconomic equilibrium a full-employment equilibrium,
below full-employment equilibrium, or above full-employment equilibrium? What is the
recessionary gap (if any)? What is the inflationary gap (if any)?
Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education, Inc.130   Parkin · Macroeconomics, Tenth Edition
Answer:
a)
See the figure above. The short-run aggregate supply curve is SAS0 .
b) A short-run macroeconomic equilibrium occurs where the aggregate demand curve,
AD, intersects the short-run aggregate supply curve, SAS0 . As the figure shows, the
short-run equilibrium real GDP is $350 billion, and the short-run equilibrium price level
is 110.
c) Long-run equilibrium real GDP equals potential GDP. So the long-run equilibrium
real GDP in Yellowland is $300 billion.
d) Yellowlandʹs short-run macroeconomic equilibrium is an above full-employment
equilibrium because the short-run equilibrium GDP exceeds potential GDP. The amount
by which real GDP exceeds potential GDP is an inflationary gap. So the inflationary gap
is $50 billion. A recessionary gap exists when real GDP is below potential GDP. So there
is no recessionary gap in Yellowland.
e) As the figure above shows, the short-run aggregate supply curve shifts from SAS0  to
SAS1 . As a result, real GDP decreases from $350 billion to $300 billion, and the price level
rises from 110 to 120.
f) Yellowlandʹs new short-run macroeconomic equilibrium is a full-employment
equilibrium because the equilibrium real GDP equals the potential GDP. When real GDP
equals potential GDP, there is neither a recessionary gap nor an inflationary gap.
