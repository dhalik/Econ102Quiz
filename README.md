===========

~~Econ 102~~ Quiz Game (decided things should be more generalized)

This is a basic quizzing program that takes in text format multiple choice input and a "ignore(ign)" file, and uses these two resources to randomly ask questions of the user.

Features:
- Dynamic Chapter selection
- Score keep
- Qt graphics? (working on it)
- Questions are removed form play after correct answer
- Other things I guess... Just haven't been thought of yet!
