Answer:  Money is any commodity or token that is generally accepted as a means of payment. It has three main functions. It serves as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Topic:  What Is Money? Skill:  Recognition Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  2) What are the three functions of money? Answer:  Money serves as a medium of exchange (so that money is accepted in exchange for goods and services), as a unit of account (so that prices are measured in units of money), and as a store of value (so that money is exchangeable at a later date). Topic:  What Is Money? Skill:  Recognition Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  3) What is barter? What is a double coincidence of wants? How does the existence of money affect barter? Answer:  Barter is the direct exchange of one good or service for another. Barter is inefficient because it requires a "double coincidence of wants," that is, the good one person offers for exchange must be the good the trading partner wants and the trading partner's good must be what the first person wants. The existence of money means that we do not need to engage in barter. Instead, we can sell a good or service for money and then use the money to purchase another good or service we desire. There is no necessity for the "double coincidence of wants" because the seller is willing to accept money from any buyer.

Ann's check, given in part (a), is a method of transferring money from Ann to someone else. Thus the check (itself) is not money. Part (d), the currency in Ann's bank, is not money until someone withdraws it because currency inside a bank does not count as money.

135 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 8) "Credit cards are considered money because they serve to purchase goods and services." Is the previous statement true or false? Answer:  The statement is false. Credit cards are an ID card that, when presented, allow the owner to get an immediate loan. A loan is not money because a loan needs to be repaid with money. Thus a credit card is not money. Topic:  Credit Cards Are Not Money Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking 9) Are credit cards or debit cards money? Explain your answer. Answer:  Neither credit cards nor debit cards are money. Credit cards are a type of ID card that, when presented, allow the owner to get an immediate loan. The loan is not money; indeed, it must be repaid using money. A debit card allows the customer to pay immediately for his or her purchase by transferring money from the customer's checking account to the seller's account. Debit cards are similar to checks insofar as they are essentially instructions to move money from one person to another. The funds transferred are money, the debit card is not money. Topic:  Credit Cards Are Not Money Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  10) Are checks and credit cards money? Explain why or why not. Answer:  Checks are not money. Checks are instructions to your depository institution allowing for funds to be given to the entity listed on the check. Credit cards also are not money. Credit cards are ID cards that allow the user to access a previously-approved line of credit. The funds borrowed using a credit card must eventually be repaid using money.

Answer:  M1 is the sum of currency outside of the banks plus checkable deposits owned by individuals and businesses plus traveler's checks. All the assets in M1 are accepted as means of payment and so all the assets are money. M2 includes all of M1 plus savings deposits, small time deposits, and money market funds. Some components of M2, such as time deposits, are not money because they are not a means of payment. But they are easily convertible into money, which is why they are included in M2.

137 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 16) What are the economic functions of depository institutions? Answer:  Depository institutions provide four economic services. First, they create liquidity, that is, bank deposits are highly liquid so that they are easily convertible into money. Second, they minimize cost of obtaining funds because borrowing from one bank is cheaper than borrowing from a variety of lenders. Third, they minimize cost of monitoring borrowers because depository institutions specialize in monitoring borrowers. Fourth, they pool risk by making loans to many borrowers. Topic:  Economic Functions of Depository Institutions Skill:  Recognition Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking 17) List and discuss the four economic functions that depository institutions provide their customers. Answer:  Depository institutions create liquidity, lower costs of obtaining funds, lower costs of monitoring borrowers, and pool risk. They create liquidity because they create assets that can be easily converted into money. Indeed, some of their deposits are money itself! They lower the costs of lending and borrowing funds. If you have funds to loan, rather than searching for a borrower, you can simply deposit the funds in a financial firm. Similarly, if you want to borrow funds, rather than searching for someone with funds to loan, you can simply borrow from a financial firm. Depository institutions also lower the cost of monitoring borrowers because these firms specialize in this activity. Finally, depository institutions pool risk and thereby lower the average risk of loaning funds. In other words, by lending to a large number of firms and individuals, a bank lowers the average risk it faces because it knows that only a small fraction of the large number of loans won't be repaid. Topic:  Economic Functions of Depository Institutions Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  18) How do banks create liquidity? Answer:  Banks create liquidity because they accept short-term deposits and make long-term loans. The short-term deposits can be quickly and easily changed into moneyindeed, some of 　the deposits are money itself! In exchange, the bank makes long-term loans that cannot be converted to money until their due date is reached.

138 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 19) Briefly describe the Federal Reserve System, how it is governed, and its roles in the economy. Answer:  The Federal Reserve, or Fed, is the U.S. central bank. The Fed consists of twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks scattered across the United States. These banks are overseen by the Board of Governors, a seven member board located in Washington D.C., whose members are appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is the group within the Fed that sets the nation's monetary policy. The voting members of the FOMC consist of the chair and other six members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four presidents of the other regional Federal Reserve Banks, on a yearly rotating basis. The Fed's primarily role in the economy is to set and conduct the nation's monetary policy. The Fed also provides banking services to banks and helps regulate the nation's financial institutions and markets. Topic:  The Federal Reserve System Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking 20) Does the Federal Reserve conduct both the nation's monetary policy and its fiscal policy?

All seven members of the Board of Governors and the 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents attend and discuss the economy at the FOMC meeting. The voting members of the FOMC, however, are only the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four presidents of the remaining Federal Reserve Banks who serve on an annual rotating basis. The FOMC meets approximately every six weeks to review the state of the economy and decide the monetary policy actions to be carried out by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

There are 12 regional banks, one for each of the 12 Federal Reserve districts. c) The Federal Open Market Committee or FOMC. The FOMC is the Fed's main policy-making committee. It has 12 voting members. Seven of the members are on the Board of Governors. One of the members is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. The other four members are presidents of other Federal Reserve Banks. Which four presidents are members changes on an annual rotating basis. Topic:  The Structure of the Federal Reserve System Skill:  Recognition Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking 27) List the Fed's main policy tools and briefly explain each one. Answer:  The Fed's main policy tools are: required reserve ratios, last resort loans, and open market operations. Banks and thrifts are required to hold a minimum percentage of deposits as reserves. This minimum percentage is determined by the Fed and is known as a required reserve ratio. The last resort loans reflects the fact that the Fed stands ready to make loans to financial institutions when other firms may be unwilling to do so. The interest rate charged on these loans is the discount rate. An open market operation is the buying and selling of government bonds by the Fed in the open market.  Topic:  The Fed's Policy Tools Skill:  Recognition Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Communication  28) What is the discount rate?

141 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 29) "When the Fed buys securities from a bank, the quantity of money eventually decreases by a fraction of the initial change in the monetary base." Is the previous statement correct or incorrect? Explain your answer. Answer:  The statement is wrong on two counts. First, if the Fed buys securities from a bank, the quantity of money increases rather than decreases. Second, the money multiplier points out that the change in the quantity of money is ultimately greater than, not less than, the initial change in the monetary base. Topic:  How an Open Market Operation Works Skill:  Analytical Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 14 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  30) When the Fed buys securities from a bank, what happens to the monetary base and the quantity of money? Which changes by more or do both change by the same amount?  Answer:  When the Fed buys securities from a bank, both the monetary base and the quantity of money increase. As reflected by the money multiplier, the increase in the quantity of money exceeds the increase in the monetary base. Topic:  How an Open Market Operation Works Skill:  Analytical Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 14 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  31) If the Fed sells $100 million of U.S. government securities, what happens to the quantity of money? Answer:  If the Fed sells $100 million of U.S. government securities, the monetary base decreases and, along with it, the quantity of money decreases. The money multiplier shows that the quantity of money decreases by more than $100 million.

How do reserves affect the amount of loans a bank can make? Answer:  Actual reserves are equal to the bank's reserves it keeps on deposit at the Federal Reserve plus the currency in the bank's vault. Desired reserves are the reserves that the bank wants to hold. The amount of desired reserves is equal to the desired reserve ratio multiplied by the bank's deposits. Excess reserves equal actual reserves minus desired reserves. A bank can make loans equal to the amount of its excess reserves.

142 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 33) "A bank can only use its excess reserves to make loans, while required reserves can only be used to buy U.S. government securities." Explain whether the previous statement is correct or incorrect. Answer:  The statement is incorrect on two dimensions. First, a bank can use excess reserves to buy government securities as well as make loans. Second, a bank is not allowed to use its required reserve to buy U.S. government securities. Required reserves must be kept in the form of reserves, which are either reserve deposits the bank has made at the Federal Reserve or cash in the bank's vault. Topic:  Reserves: Actual and Required Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  34) Explain the process by which the banking system creates money. Answer:  When a bank gains excess reserves, it uses the excess reserves to make a loan. The person or a business receiving the loan receives a depositmoney! The borrower then generally 　spends the loan and it ends up as a depositmoneyin another company's account. That 　　company's bank then gains some excess reserves, which it loans, and so more money is created. Thus the banking system creates money by making loans. Topic:  Reserves and Loans Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  35) What factors affect the demand for money? Answer:  Four factors influence the demand for money. First is the price level. An increase in the price level increases the nominal demand for money. Second is the interest rate. An increase in the interest rate raises the opportunity cost of holding money and decreases the quantity of money demanded. Third is real GDP. An increase in real GDP increases the demand for money. Fourth is financial innovation. Innovations that lower the cost of switching between money and other assets decrease the demand for money. Topic:  The Influences on Money Holding Skill:  Recognition Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking 36) How are the nominal and real demands for money related to changes in the price level? Answer:  When the price level rises the nominal demand for money increases by the same proportion. For example if the price level rises 5 percent, people demand 5 percent more nominal money so that they can continue to purchase the same quantity of goods and services. The nominal demand is measured in number of dollars. The real demand is the quantity of money measured in constant dollars. This amount does not change when the price level rises. The quantity of real money demanded is independent of the price level.

143 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 37) What is the opportunity cost of holding money? Answer:  The opportunity cost of holding money is the nominal interest rate. Topic:  Influences on Money Holding, The Interest Rate Skill:  Recognition Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  38) Why is the nominal interest rate the opportunity cost of holding money? Answer:  The nominal interest rate is the opportunity cost of holding money because the interest is the income forgone by holding money. For instance, an individual with $1,000 can hold the funds either as money or as a financial asset with an interest rate of, say, 7 percent. If the funds are held as money, the interest paid is $0; if they are held as a financial asset, the interest paid is $70. Choosing to hold the funds as money therefore has an opportunity cost of the interest income forgone, which is $70 or 7 percent per dollar. So, the opportunity cost of each dollar held as money is 7 percent.

144 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 42) Describe how financial innovation has affected the demand for money. Answer:  Financial innovation is the development by depository institutions of new financial products and changing technology within the banking industry. Examples include daily interest checking deposits, automatic transfers of money between deposits, ATM's and credit cards. In general these innovations have allowed the public to be more flexible in their choices between cash and less liquid assets as banks have delivered greater liquidity without forgoing interest earned. The result has been a large decrease in the demand for M1 and a smaller decrease in the demand for M2. Topic:  Shifts in the Demand for Money Curve Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  43) Explain how the money market determines the equilibrium interest rate. Answer:  The demand for money curve, MD, is downward sloping because as the interest rate decreases the quantity of money demanded increases. The supply of money curve, MS, is vertical at the quantity of real money. There exists only one interest rate for which the quantity of money demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. If the interest rate is above the equilibrium interest rate, so that there is an excess supply of money, people respond by buying bonds so that the interest rate falls. Likewise, if the interest rate is less than the equilibrium interest rate, so that there is an excess demand for money, people respond by selling bonds and the interest rate rises. Topic:  Money Market Equilibrium Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Communication  44) Suppose the quantity of money is greater than the quantity of money demanded. In the short run, what occurs to set the quantity of money equal to the quantity of money demanded? Answer:  In the money market, the interaction between the supply of money and the demand for money determines the equilibrium interest rate. The quantity of money is greater than the quantity of the money demanded when the interest rate is above the equilibrium interest rate. When this occurs, in an effort to decrease the amount of money to be equal to the quantity they want to hold, people buy bonds with the excess money. As a result, the interest rate falls. The fall in the interest rate increases the quantity of money demanded. When the interest rate reaches its equilibrium, there is no longer an excess supply of money because at the equilibrium interest rate, the quantity of money supplied equals the quantity demanded.

145 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 45) In the short run, how is the interest rate determined? If the interest rate is less than the equilibrium interest rate, what occurs? Answer:  The interest rate is determined in the money market by the interaction of the demand for money and the supply of money. If the interest rate is less than the equilibrium, there is an excess demand for money. In order to increase the quantity of money they hold, people sell bonds and other financial assets. As a result, the price of financial assets falls and the interest rate rises. People continue to sell assets and the interest rate continues to rise until it reaches its equilibrium.

146 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 48) Discuss the quantity theory of money. Be sure to mention the velocity of circulation and the equation of exchange. Answer:  The quantity theory of money is the proposition that in the long run an increase in the money supply leads to an equal percentage increase in the price level. The velocity of circulation is defined as the average number of times a dollar is used annually in exchange for goods and services. Because GDP is the total of all goods and services purchased, we can derive a formula for the velocity of circulation from GDP. If we use Y for real GDP and P as the price level, the PY = nominal GDP. Because the money supply is used to purchase GDP, velocity, V, equals (PY)/M, where M is the quantity of money. This formula can be rearranged to become the equation of exchange, which states that MV = PY. Given the assumptions that neither velocity nor potential GDP are influenced by the quantity of money, we can then solve for the price level as P = (MV/Y). Given the assumptions then, changes in the quantity of money lead to only changes in the price level. The quantity theory states that in the long run the percentage increase in the quantity of money equals the percentage increase in the price level. Topic:  Quantity Theory of Money Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Communication 49) Define the quantity theory of money and show how it is related to the equation of exchange. Answer:  The quantity theory of money is the proposition that in the long run, an increase in the quantity of money brings an equal percentage increase in the price level (other things remaining the same). The equation of exchange states that the quantity of money multiplied by velocity of circulation equals the price level times real GDP, or M × V = P × Y. Divide both sides of this formula by V to obtain P = (M × V) ÷ Y. This formula shows that when M increases, as long as V and Y do not change, P increases by the same percentage, which is the conclusion of the quantity theory of money. Topic:  Quantity Theory of Money Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Communication  50) What is the equation of exchange? Suppose that real GDP and velocity are constant. In this case, what effect will an increase in the quantity of money have? Answer:  The equation of exchange is that M × V = P × Y, where M is the quantity of money, V is the velocity of circulation, P is the price level, and Y is real GDP. If real GDP and velocity are constant, then an increase in the quantity of money will increase the price level.

Explain whether the previous statement is correct or incorrect.  Answer:  The statement is false. If the currency drain increases, the money multiplier (and the quantity of money) decreases but the monetary base itself is unaffected. Topic:  Requies Mathematical Note Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking 54) What is a "currency drain?" How and why does it affect the money multiplier? Answer:  An increase in currency held outside the banks is a currency drain. A currency drain decreases the size of the money multiplier. The money multiplier exists because when banks loan their excess reserves, the funds wind up in other banks as excess reserves, where they are loaned once again. As a result, an initial increase in reserves and the monetary base wind up increasing the quantity of money by a magnified amount. A currency drain means that when banks make loans, some of the funds are taken out as cash and not deposited back in another bank. Thus the other banks' excess reserves do not increase as much, so the amount that they can loan is decreased. The decrease in loans means that the ultimate increase in the quantity of money is less, so that the money multiplier is smaller.

148 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 55) How does a currency drain affect the money multiplier? Answer:  If the currency drain is zero so that all money created is deposited in bank accounts, the money multiplier is equal to one divided by the desired reserve ratio. If the currency drain is positive, then some newly created money is held in cash and is not deposited in bank accounts. In this case, the money multiplier is smaller so that a change in the monetary base leads to a smaller change in the quantity of money. Topic:  Requies Mathematical Note Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Analytical Skills  56) Explain how a currency drain affects the size of the money multiplier. In your explanation, suppose that a bank gains $1 million in new deposits and reserves. Further suppose that the desired reserve ratio is 10 percent and the currency drain is 50 percent. Answer:  A currency drain decreases the size of the money multiplier. The money multiplier reflects the fact that the banking system has a magnified effect on any change in reserves because the reserves are loaned by many banks. A currency drain decreases the amount of reserves that stay within the banking system. For example, take the bank that gains $1 million in new deposits and reserves. With the desired reserve ratio equal to 10 percent, start by assuming there is no currency drain. In this case, the desired reserve ratio of 10 percent means that the bank will keep $100,000 as reserves and so it will loan $900,000. The entire $900,000 will be deposited in a second bank. The entire $900,000 deposit adds to the initial $1 million deposit to create $1.9 million of new money. That bank will then keep $90,000 as reserves and loan $810,000. In this stage, the entire $810,000 will be deposited in a third bank and so the total new money (so far) created will become $2.71 million. Now, suppose that there is a currency drain, say of 50 percent. In this case, of the $900,000 first loan, only $600,000 is deposited in the second bank because $300,000 (50 percent of the $600,000 of newly created deposit money) is kept outside the banks as currency. Hence the second bank, which must keep $60,000 as reserves, can loan only $540,000. And of this loan, 50 percent or $180,000 is kept as currency and only $360,000 is deposited in the third bank. Therefore the amount that each bank can loan is reduced and so the ultimate effect on the quantity of money is decreased. Topic:  Requies Mathematical Note Skill:  Analytical Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Analytical Skills 57) If the currency drain increases, how can the Fed adjust the monetary base to offset the effect on the quantity of money? Answer:  If the currency drain increases, the size of the money multiplier decreases, which decreases the quantity of money. To maintain the quantity of money at its initial amount by changing the monetary base, the Fed must increase the monetary base.

149 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 58) What is the money multiplier and what affects its size? Answer:  The money multiplier is the amount by which a change in the monetary base is multiplied to determine the change in the quantity of money. The money multiplier is greater than 1.0. Its size is affected by the desired reserve ratio and the currency drain. The higher the desired reserve ratio and/or the larger the currency drain, the smaller the money multiplier. Topic:  Requies Mathematical Note Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Analytical Skills  59) Suppose the Fed buys government securities from a commercial bank. Why is there a multiplier effect on the quantity of money? Answer:  When the Fed buys government securities from a bank, the payment to the bank is in the form of reserves. Hence the bank gains excess reserves. The bank can loan these excess reserves. When the loan is spent, the recipients deposit some or all of the funds in their banks. These banks gain deposits (which increase the quantity of money) as well as excess reserves. The "second round" banks then loan their excess reserves. And when these loans are spent, once again the recipients deposit some or all of the funds in their banks. These third-round banks thereby gain deposits (which further increases the quantity of money) as well as excess reserves. These reserves are loaned, spent, and then deposited in a fourth round of banks, which still further increases the quantity of money. Hence the process of loaning and depositing the proceeds increases the quantity of money by a multiple of the initial amount of the open market operation.

Answer:  TRUE Topic:  International Evidence on the Quantity Theory of Money Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  11  Extended Problems  1) The commercial banks in Fundland have  Reserves $500 million  Loans $3,500 million  Deposits $4,000 million  Total assets $5,000 million The banks hold no excess reserves. a) Calculate the banks' desired reserve ratio. b) An immigrant arrives in Fundland with $10 million, which she deposits in a bank. How much does the immigrant's bank lend initially? Answer:   a) With no excess reserves, the desired reserve ratio is the fraction of banks' total deposits that are held in reserves. So in Fundland, the banks' desired reserve ratio is 500/4000 = 0.125 or 12.5 percent. b) With a desired reserve ratio of 12.5 percent, the bank keeps $10 million × 0.125 = $1.25 million on reserve. It then lends the rest, so it lends $10 million - $1.25 million, which is $8.75 million.

162 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 2) The commercial banks in Lendland have  Reserves $400 million  Loans $3,600 million  Deposits $4,000 million  Total assets $4,600 million The banks hold no excess reserves. a) Calculate the banks' reserve ratio. b) An immigrant arrives in Lendland with $5 million, which he deposits in a bank. How much does the immigrant's bank lend initially? Answer:   a) With no excess reserves, the desired reserve ratio is the fraction of banks' total deposits that are held in reserves. So in Lendland, the banks' desired reserve ratio is 400/4000 = 0.1 or 10 percent. b) With a desired reserve ratio of 10 percent, the bank keeps $5 million × 0.10 = $0.5 million on reserve. It then lends the rest, so it lends $5 million - $0.5 million, which is $4.5 million. Topic:  Reserves and Loans Skill:  Analytical Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Analytical Skills  3) In the economy of Briskland, the commercial banks have deposits of $500 billion. Their reserves are $50 billion, 80 percent of which is in deposits with the Central Bank. There is $20 billion in Central Bank notes outside the banks, and there are no coins. a) What is the monetary base? b) If all the deposits are money, what is the total quantity of money? c) What is the banks' reserve ratio? d) What is the currency drain as a percentage of the quantity of deposits? Answer:   a) The monetary base is the sum of Central Bank notes, $20 billion, and deposits at the Central Bank. The deposits at the central bank are 80 percent of banks' reserves, so deposits at the central bank are 0.8 × $50 billion which is $40 billion. Then the monetary base is $20 billion + $40 billion = $60 billion b) The quantity of money is Central Bank notes plus deposits, so the quantity of money is $20 billion + $500 billion = $520 billion c) The banks' reserve ratio is the ratio of banks' reserve to deposits, which is $50/$500 = 0.1 or 10 percent. d) The currency drain is Central Bank notes held outside the banks. In Briskland, the currency drain is $20 billion, so as a percentage of the quantity of money, the currency drain is $20 billion/$500 billion = 0.04 or 4.0 percent.

163 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 4) Friedmania is a country in which the quantity theory of money operates. The country has a constant population, capital stock, and technology so real GDP does not change. In 2010, real GDP was $500 million, the price level, measured by the GDP deflator, was 150 and the velocity of circulation of money was 10. (Because the price level is measured by the GDP deflator, it must be divided by 100 before it is used in the equation of exchange.) In 2011, the quantity of money increased by 20 percent. a) What was the quantity of money in 2010? b) What was the velocity of circulation in 2011? c) What was the price level in 2010? Answer:   a) The equation of exchange states that the quantity of money, M, multiplied by the velocity of circulation, V, equals real GDP, Y, multiplied by the price level, P. In terms of a formula, the equation of exchange is that M x V = P x Y Using this formula, M = PY/V, [(150/1000 × $500 billion]/10 gives the quantity of money as $75 billion. b) The quantity theory of money asserts that the velocity of circulation is not influenced by the quantity of money. So the velocity of circulation remains constant at 10. c) From the equation of exchange, the price level is P = MV/Y.  Because the quantity of money increased by 20 percent, the quantity of money in 2011 is $75 billion × 1.2 = $90 billion So P = [($90 billion × 100/$500 million] × 100 = 180 Another way to calculate the price level in 2011 is to notice that according to the quantity theory, a change in the quantity of money has no effect on velocity and real GDP. So if the quantity of money increases by 20 percent, to balance the equation of exchange, the price level must also increase by 20 percent. So from this approach, the price level in Friedmania is 150 × 1.2, which is also equal to 180.

164 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 5) Fisheria is a country in which the quantity theory of money operates. The country has a constant population, capital stock, and technology. In 2010, real GDP was $300 million, the quantity of money was $60, and the velocity of circulation of money was 10. In 2011, the price level rose by 20 percent. a) What was the price level in 2010? (The price level is measured by the GDP deflator, which is 100 in 2000. So the price level from the equation of exchange needs to be multiplied by 100 to convert it to the GDP deflator.) b) What was real GDP in 2011? c) What was the velocity of circulation in 2011? d) What was the quantity of money in 2011? Answer:   a) The equation of exchange states that the quantity of money, M, multiplied by the velocity of circulation, V, equals real GDP, Y, multiplied by the price level, P. In terms of a formula, the equation of exchange is that M × V = P × Y. This formula shows that P = MV/Y. Using this result, the price level is [($60 × 10)/$300] = 2.0, which must be multiplied by 100 so that the price level is 200. b) Real GDP does not change because the country has a constant population, capital stock, and technology, and, according to the quantity theory of money, real GDP is not influenced by changes in the quantity of money. So real GDP in 2011 is $300 million. c) The quantity theory of money asserts that the velocity of circulation is not influenced by the quantity of money. So the velocity of circulation remains constant at 10. d) From the equation of exchange, the quantity of money is M = PY/V. Because the price level in 2011 increased by 20 percent, the price level in 2011 is 200 × 1.2 = 240. So using the equation of exchange formula, M = [(240/100) × $300]/10 = $72 billion. Another way to calculate the quantity of money in 2011 is to notice that according to the quantity theory, a change in the quantity of money has no effect on velocity and real GDP. So if the price level rises by 20 percent, to balance the equation of exchange, the quantity of money must also increase by 20 percent. So from this approach, in 2011 the quantity of money in Fisheria is $60 billion × 1.2 = $72 billion.

165 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 6) In the economy of Brightland, the commercial banks have deposits of $600 billion. Their reserves are $60 billion. All reserves are in deposits with the Central Bank and the commercial banks hold no excess reserves. There is $120 billion in Central Bank notes outside the banks, and there are no coins. a) What is the economy's monetary base? b) What is the quantity of money in the economy? c) Calculate the money multiplier. d) Suppose the Central Bank of Brightland undertakes an open market purchase of securities of so that the monetary base increases by $5 billion. By how much will the quantity of money change? Answer:   a) The monetary base is the sum of Central Bank notes and deposits at the Central Bank, so the monetary base is $120 billion + $60 billion = $180 billion b) The quantity of money equals notes plus deposits, which is $120 billion + $600 billion = $720 billion c) The money multiplier is (1 + c)/(r + c), where c is the ratio of currency to deposits and r is the desired reserve ratio. In Brightland, the ratio of currency to deposits is $120 billion/$600 billion = 0.2. Because there are no excess reserves, the desired reserve ratio is $60 billion/$600 billion = 0.1. So the money multiplier is (1 + 0.2)/(0.1 + 0.2) = 4.0. d) The quantity of money in the economy increases by the change in the monetary base multiplied by the money multiplier, so the quantity of money increases by $5 × 4 billion = $20 billion Topic:  Requies Mathematical Note Skill:  Analytical Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 8 AACSB:  Analytical Skills
