Answer:  A currency depreciates when it becomes less valuable in the foreign exchange market. For instance, if the exchange rate changes from 130 yen per dollar to 110 yen per dollar, the dollar has depreciated. A currency appreciation is the exact opposite: A currency appreciates when it becomes less valuable in the foreign exchange market. For instance, if the exchange rate changes from 130 yen per dollar to 150 yen per dollar, the dollar has appreciated.

123 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 3) In the foreign exchange market, how does the quantity of U.S. dollars demanded respond to a change in the U.S. exchange rate? Why is there this response? Answer:  If the U.S. exchange rate falls, the quantity of U.S. dollars demanded increases for two reasons. The first is the exports effect. If the exchange rate falls, then U.S. goods and services are cheaper in foreign nations. These nations increase the amount of U.S. exports they demand. As exports increase the quantity of dollars demanded increases so that the importing nations can pay for the exports. The second reason the quantity of U.S. dollars demanded increases is the expected profit effect. In general, the greater the expected profit from holding U.S. dollars, the greater is the quantity demanded of U.S. dollars. When the exchange rate falls, more people will believe that it will rise again in the future and so more people want to hold U.S. dollars. As a result, the quantity of U.S. dollars demanded increases. Topic:  Law of Demand for Foreign Exchange Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 9 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  4) In the foreign exchange market, how does each of the following influences affect the demand for dollars and the demand curve for dollars? a) an increase in the exchange rate. b) an increase in the U.S. interest rate. c) a fall in the expected future exchange rate. Answer:   a) The increase in the exchange rate decreases the quantity of dollars demanded and creates an upward movement along the demand curve for dollars. b) An increase in the U.S. interest rate increases the demand for dollars and shifts the demand curve for dollars rightward. c) A fall in the expected future exchange rate decreases the demand for dollars and shifts the demand curve for dollars leftward. Topic:  Demand for Foreign Exchange Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 9 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking 5) Name three factors in the foreign exchange market that affect either the quantity of dollars demanded or the demand for dollars. Discuss whether the factor increases or decreases the number of dollars people want to hold. Answer:  Three factors are the exchange rate, the U.S. interest rate differential, and the expected future exchange rate. If the exchange rate rises, the quantity of dollars demanded decreases. If the U.S. interest rate differential is larger (either because the U.S. interest rate rose or because foreign interest rates fell) then the demand for dollars increases. And, if the expected future value of the exchange rate is higher, then the current demand for dollars increases.

124 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 6) Explain the effect on the demand for dollars in the foreign exchange market of an increase in the U.S. interest rate differential. Answer:  As the U.S. interest rate differential increases, international investors can obtain a greater return by holding U.S. assets. Therefore these investors want to buy more U.S. assets, such as bonds. But in order to buy more U.S. assets, they need more dollars. Hence the increase in the U.S. interest rate differential leads to an increase in the demand for dollars in the foreign exchange market and so the demand curve for U.S. dollars shifts rightward. Topic:  Changes in the Demand for Dollars, Interest Rates Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 9 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  7) In the foreign exchange market, how does a change in the expected future U.S. exchange rate affect the demand for dollars? Answer:  Changes in the expected future exchange rate change the demand for dollars. If the expected future exchange rate falls, the demand for dollars decreases and the demand curve shifts leftward because the expected profit from holding dollars decreases. If the expected future exchange rate rises, the demand for dollars increases and the demand curve shifts rightward because the expected profit from holding dollars increases.

125 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 10) In the foreign exchange market, how does a change in expected future U.S. exchange rate affect the supply of dollars? Answer:  Changes in the expected future exchange rate change the supply of dollars. If the expected future exchange rate falls, the supply of dollars increases and the supply curve shifts rightward because the expected profit from holding dollars decreases. If the expected future exchange rate rises, the supply of dollars decreases and the supply curve shifts leftward because the expected profit from holding dollars increases.

Briefly explain whether the previous statement is correct or incorrect.  Answer:  The statement is correct. The increase in the demand for dollars shifts the demand curve for dollars rightward and creates a shortage of dollars at the initial exchange rate. This shortage puts upward pressure on the exchange rate and so the exchange rate rises to its new equilibrium value. Topic:  Changes in the Exchange Rate Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 9 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  12) What happens in the foreign exchange market if the U.S. interest rate increases? What is the effect on the exchange rate? Answer:  In the foreign exchange market, the increase in the U.S. interest rate increases the demand for dollars and the demand curve for dollars shifts rightward. The increase in the interest rate also decreases the supply of dollars and the supply curve of dollars shifts leftward. As a result, the exchange rate rises so that the dollar appreciates. Topic:  Changes in the Exchange Rate Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 9 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  13) How will an increase in the expected future exchange rate affect the current supply and demand curves for dollars?

126 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 14) What is purchasing power parity? Answer:  Purchasing power parity means "equal value of money," that is, the exchange rate adjusts so that one currency can buy the same amount of goods and services as another currency. Topic:  Purchasing Power Parity Skill:  Recognition Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 9 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  15) "Fluctuations in exchange rates, other things remaining the same, creates a situation in which money buys the same amount of goods and services in different currencies." What does the previous statement describe? Will these fluctuations occur in the short run or the long run? Answer:  The statement describes purchasing power parity, the proposition that money will buy the same amount of goods and services in different currencies. The effects of purchasing power parity will change the exchange rate in the long run. In the short run, deviations from purchasing power parity can occur. Topic:  Purchasing Power Parity Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 9 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  16) What role can the Fed play in the foreign exchange market? Answer:  The Federal Reserve can intervene in the foreign exchange market by (temporarily) selling or buying dollars. If the Fed sells dollars, it drives the exchange rate lower and if the Fed buys dollars, it drives the exchange rate higher. The Fed cannot buy dollars forever because it will run out of the foreign exchange it using to buy the dollars. And, the Fed likely will not want to sell dollars forever because it would accumulate ever increasing amounts of foreign exchange. Topic:  The Fed in the Foreign Exchange Market Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 9 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  17) How does the Fed intervene in the foreign exchange market and what the effects are of the Fed's actions? Answer:  The Fed intervenes in the foreign exchange market and changes the value of the exchange rate by buying or selling dollars. If the Fed wants to raise the exchange rate and appreciate the dollar, the Fed will buy dollars. By buying dollars the Fed increases the demand for dollars and raises the exchange rate. If the Fed wants to lower the exchange rate and depreciate the dollar, the Fed will sell dollars. By selling dollars the Fed increases the supply of dollars and lowers the exchange rate.

127 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 18) If the Fed wants to lower the U.S. exchange rate, what action should it take in the foreign exchange market? Why does the action lower the exchange rate? Answer:  To lower the exchange rate, the Fed should sell dollars and buy foreign currency. By selling dollars, the Fed increases the supply of dollars, which lowers the U.S. exchange rate. Topic:  The Fed in the Foreign Exchange Market Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 9 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  19) What are the three balance of payments accounts? Briefly describe them. What is the relationship among the three? Answer:  The three balance of payment accounts are the current account, the capital account, and the official settlements account. The current account records exports, imports, net interest, and net transfers. The capital account records foreign investment in the United States and U.S. investment abroad. Finally, the official settlements account shows changes in U.S. official reserves, the government holdings of foreign currency. The relationship is that the current account balance plus capital account balance plus official settlements account must sum to zero. Topic:  Balance of Payments Accounts Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 9 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  20) "The current account records foreign investment in a nation minus investment abroad." Is the previous statement correct or incorrect? Answer:  The statement is incorrect. The current account equals exports minus imports plus net interest plus net transfers. The capital account records foreign investment in a nation minus investment abroad.

128 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 21) What are the main components of the current account? What has been the recent U.S. experience with these items? Answer:  The current account records payments for the imported of goods and services and the receipts for exported of goods and services. These two components of the current account are by far the largest components. In addition to the value of imports and exports, the current account also includes the net interest income paid abroad and net transfers. Net interest income measures the interest payments both made and received which flow from previously purchased assets. Net transfers record such items as foreign aid payments. Over recent years, the U.S. current account has been negative, that is, there has been a current account deficit. Over these years, the United States has experienced a perennial trade deficit, which means that the value of imports has exceeded the value of exports. The trade deficit has been the primary cause why the U.S. current account has been negative. Net interest income has been barely negative while net transfers are also negative and slightly larger in magnitude than net interest income. Topic:  Balance of Payments Accounts Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 9 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking 22) What balance of payment account records foreign investment between countries? Answer:  The capital account records foreign investment between countries. The U.S. capital account equals foreign investment in the United States minus U.S. investment abroad. Topic:  Balance of Payments Accounts Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 9 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  23) How do the capital account and the current account differ? Answer:  The current account and the capital account differ in what is recorded in each. The current account records exports, imports, net interest, and net transfers. The capital account records foreign investment in the United States and U.S. investment abroad.

129 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 24) Define official settlements account and U.S. official reserves. Discuss the differences between the two terms. Answer:  The official settlements account is the record of the change in a country's official reserves. U.S. official reserves are the U.S. government's holdings of foreign currency. If the U.S. official reserves increases, the official settlements account balance is negative. The reason the official settlements account decreases is that holding foreign money is similar to investing abroad insofar as both buying foreign money and buying foreign assets (that is, investing abroad) use (rather than acquire) U.S. dollars. Topic:  Balance of Payments Accounts Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 9 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  25) If U.S. official reserves increase, is the official settlements account balance positive, negative, or unaffected? Answer:  If U.S. official reserves increase, the official settlements account balance is negative. Topic:  Balance of Payments Accounts Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 9 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  26) "If the official settlements balance is zero, a current account surplus must equal the capital account deficit." Is the previous statement correct or incorrect? Briefly explain your answer. Answer:  The statement is correct. The sum of the current account balance plus the capital account balance plus the official settlements account must equal zero. If the official settlements account balance is zero, then the sum of the current account balance plus the capital account balance must equal zero. Therefore a current account surplus must be "balanced" by an equally-sized capital account deficit. Topic:  Balance of Payments Accounts Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 9 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking 27) Looking at the U.S. balance of payments for the last two decades, how have the current account and the capital account changed? Answer:  Since the early 1980s and onward, the U.S. current account has been negative and sometimes quite large. The U.S. capital account has more or less mirrored the current account, only it has been positive rather than negative. Thus when the current account deficit is small, the capital account surplus is small and when the current account deficit is large, the capital account surplus is large.

130 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 28) Define net borrower, net lender, creditor nation, and debtor nation. Discuss the difference between a net borrower and a debtor nation. Answer:  A country that is borrowing more from the rest of the world than it is lending to the rest of the world is a net borrower. A country that is lending more to the rest of the world than it borrows from the rest of the world is a net lender. A country that during its entire history has borrowed more from the rest of the world than it has lent to the rest of the world is a debtor nation. A country that has invested more in the rest of the world than other countries have invested in it is a creditor nation. A net borrower is a country that is currently borrowing whereas a debtor nation has a stock of outstanding debt. Borrowing is a flow variable and the outstanding debt is a stock. Thus a net borrower could be a creditor nation that is currently borrowing or it could be a debtor nation that is currently borrowing and thereby increasing its debt. Topic:  Borrowers and Lenders, Debtors and Creditors Skill:  Conceptual Question history:  Previous edition, Chapter 9 AACSB:  Reflective Thinking  29) What is the relationship between net borrower, net lender, debtor nation, and creditor nation? Answer:  If a nation is currently borrowing from the world more than it is lending to the world, the nation is a net borrower. If a nation is currently lending more to the world more than it is borrowing from the world, the nation is a net lender. If during its entire history a nation has borrowed more than it has lent, the nation is a debtor nation. If during its entire history a nation has lent more than it has borrowed, the nation is a creditor nation. The distinction between borrowing or lending and being a debtor or creditor deals is the distinction between a flow and a stock. A nation that is a net borrower is increasing its debt (or decreasing its assets). The net borrowing is the flow that adds to the stock of debt (or decreases the stock of assets). A nation that is a net lender is increasing its assets (or decreasing its debt). The net lending is the flow that adds to the stock of assets (or decreases the stock of debt).

Is the previous statement correct or incorrect? Briefly explain your answer. Answer:  The statement is incorrect. Aside from changes in the official settlements account, any nation that is running a current account deficit must be paying for the excess of imports over exports by borrowing from abroad. The United States is no exception and with its large current account deficits, the United States is a large net borrower from abroad.

Is the United States a debtor nation? Answer:  A debtor nation is a country that during its entire history has borrowed more from the rest of the world than it has lent to it. Although the United States was a creditor nation until the 1980s, its borrowing during the 1980s means that today the United States is a debtor nation.

The price of a car in Germany is 10,000 euros. The current exchange rate is 0.9 euros per dollar. a) If a computer is exported from the United States to Germany with no barriers to trade, what will be the price of the computer in Germany? b) If a car is imported to the United States from Germany with no barriers to trade, what will be the price of the car in the United States? c) Suppose the dollar appreciates by 10 percent against the euro. How will the price of a computer exported from the United States change in Germany? d) Suppose the dollar appreciates by 10 percent against the euro. How will the price of a car imported to the United States from Germany change in the United States? Answer:   a) The price of an American computer in Germany is $1,000 × 0.9 euros per dollar, which is 900 euros. b) The price of a German car in the United States is 10,000 euros/0.9 euros per dollar = $11,111. c) The new exchange rate is 0.9 euros per dollar × 1.1 = 0.99 euros per dollar. So the new price of a U.S. computer in Germany is $1,000 × 0.99 euros per dollar = 990 euros. The price of a U.S. computer in Germany rises by 10 percent. d) The new price of a German car in the United States is 10,000 euros/0.99 euros per dollar = $10,101. So the price of a German car in the United States falls by about 10 percent.

143 Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education 2) Suppose that the price of a Big Mac is a good approximation of the price level in the country. A Big Mac costs £2 in London and $3 in New York. a) If purchasing power parity holds, what is the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the British pound? b) If the current exchange rate is $1.6 per pound, what is the dollar price of a Big Mac in London? What do you predict will happen to the exchange rate? Explain. c) The exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Russian ruble is 30 rubles per dollar. If purchasing power parity holds, what is the price of a Big Mac in Moscow? Answer:   a) If purchasing power parity holds, the dollar price of a Big Mac in London must be the same as that in New York. This is the case when the exchange rate is $1.5 per pound. With this exchange rate, the dollar price of a Big Mac in London is £2 × 1.5 dollars per pound = $3. b) If the current exchange rate is $1.6 per pound, the dollar price of a Big Mac in London is £2 × 1.6 dollars per pound, which is $3.20. If the price of a Big Mac represents the price level in the country, British goods are relatively more expensive than American goods. The quantity of the U.K. imports demanded decreases in the United States and the quantity of U.S. exports demanded increases in the United Kingdom. The demand for dollars in the foreign exchange market increases and the demand for pounds decreases. As a result, the dollar appreciates against the pound until the purchasing-power-parity exchange rate is restored. c) If purchasing power parity holds, the dollar price of a Big Mac in Moscow must be the same as in New York, that is, $3. Given the ruble/dollar exchange rate, the price of a Big Mac in Moscow is $3 × 30 rubles per dollar, which is 90 rubles.

 3) The citizens of Exland, whose currency is the bun, conduct the transactions outlined in the table above. a) What is Exland's current account balance? b) What is Exland's capital account balance? c) What is Exland's official settlement balance? d) What is Exland's net foreign borrowing? Answer:   a) The current account balance equals exports minus imports: 700 - 600 = 100 billion buns. b) The capital account balance equals foreign investment in Exland minus Exland's investment abroad: 350 - 430 = -80 billion buns c) A country's official settlement balance is the change in its official reserves. If official reserves increase, the official settlement balance is negative. So Exland's official settlement balance is -20 billion buns. d) A country's net foreign borrowing is the difference between its borrowing from the rest of the world and its lending to the rest of the world. Exland's foreign borrowing is the foreign investment in Exland (350 billion buns). Exland's foreign lending is its investment abroad (430 billion buns) plus the increase in the official holdings of foreign currency (20 billion buns). So Exland's net foreign borrowing is 350 - 430 - 20 = -100 billion buns which means the country is a net foreign lender.

 4) The table above shows some data for Wiland, a country whose currency is the bont. The official settlement balance, net interest income, and net transfers from abroad are zero. a) What is Wiland's imports of goods and services? b) What is Wiland's current account balance? c) What is Wiland's capital account balance? d) What is Wiland's net taxes? e) What is Wiland's private sector balance? Answer:  a) The country's net exports are GDP minus consumption minus investment minus government purchases, which is 320 - 200 - 80 - 60 = -20 billion bonts. Net exports are the difference between imports and exports. Because Wiland's exports are 40 billion bonts and its net exports are -20 billion bonts, then it imports must equal 60 billion bonts. b) Because net interest income and net transfers from abroad are zero, the current account balance equals net exports, so the current account balance is -20 billion bonts. c) Because the official settlement balance is zero, the sum of the capital account balance and current account balance is zero, which means that the capital account balance is 20 billion bonts. d) The government budget deficit is the difference between government purchases and net taxes, which means net taxes equal government purchases minus the budget deficit. So in Wiland, net taxes are 60 - 25, which is 35 billion bonts. e) The private sector balance is saving minus investment. Saving is GDP minus net taxes minus consumption. In Wiland, saving is 320 - 35 - 200 = 85 billion bonts. So the country's private sector balance is 85 - 80 = 5 billion bonts, that is, a surplus of 5 billion bonts.
