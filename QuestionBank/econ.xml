      <q>Why does the Bank of Canada pay close attention to the core inflation rate in addition to the overall CPI inflation rate?</q>
      <a>The core rate is more volatile and therefore a better predictor of trend inflation.</a>
      <b>The core rate includes taxes, while the overall CPI rate does not.</b>
      <c>The core rate has a lower average value and therefore makes the Bank look better.</c>
      <d>The core rate is less volatile and a better predictor of future CPI inflation.</d>
      <e>The core rate excludes eight volatile prices and is therefore more likely to stay within the target band.</e>
