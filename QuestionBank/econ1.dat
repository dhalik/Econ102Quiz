6  Essay Questions
1) In the aggregate demand-aggregate supply framework, how does an increase in the price level
affect potential GDP?
Answer: An increase in the price level has no effect on potential GDP. Potential GDP is
independent of the price level, so increases or decreases in the price level have no effect
on potential GDP.

2) How are potential GDP, full employment and the LAS curve related?
Answer: When the economy is at full employment there is no cyclical unemployment and the
economy is at its potential level of real GDP. The LAS curve is vertical at the level of
potential real GDP.

3) Give examples of factors that decrease short-run aggregate supply. Which way does the SAS
curve shift?
Answer: Aggregate supply decreases if potential GDP decreases. In addition, cost hikes such as a
rise in the money wage rate or the price of oil, decreases short -run aggregate supply.
Whenever short-run aggregate supply decreases, the SAS curve shifts leftward.

4) What is the difference between the long-run aggregate supply and the short-run aggregate
supply curves?
Answer: The long-run aggregate supply curve, LAS, is the relationship between the price level
and real GDP when real GDP equals potential GDP. The LAS curve is vertical. Along the
LAS curve, both the prices of goods and services and the prices of resources, such as the
money wage rate, change. The short-run aggregate supply curve, SAS, is the relationship
between the price level and the quantity of real GDP supplied in the short run when the
money wage rate and other resource prices are constant. The SAS curve slopes upward.
Along the SAS curve, only the price level changes; the money wage rate and other
resource prices are constant. The SAS curve shifts leftward when the money wage rate (or
other costs) rise.

5) How do changes in the money wage rate affect the LAS and SAS curves? Explain your answer.
Answer: If the money wage rate changes, the  LAS curve is not affected but the SAS curve shifts.
For instance, if the money wage rate rises, the LAS curve does not change but the SAS
curve shifts leftward. The difference occurs because moving along the LAS curve both the
money wage rate and price level change in the same proportion. So in this case, a change
in the money wage rate is matched by a change in the price level and firms have no
incentive to change their production of goods and services. But moving along the  SAS
curve, only the price level changes. So when the money wage rate changes and the price
level does not change, firms have an incentive to change their production. For instance, if
the money wage rate rises and the price level does not change, then firms decrease their
production of goods and services and the SAS curve shifts leftward.

6) What are the factors that can shift the short-run aggregate supply curve but not the long-run
aggregate supply curve? Explain your answer.
Answer: The only factor that shifts the short-run aggregate supply curve but not the long-run
aggregate supply curve is a change in the money wage rate or the money prices of other
resources. For instance, an increase in the money wage rate shifts the  SAS curve leftward,
but does not shift the LAS curve.

7) Explain the reasons why the AD curve slopes downward.
Answer: There are two reasons why the AD curve slopes downward: the wealth effect and
substitution effects.
The wealth effect points out how changes in the price level cause changes in the real
value of wealth. Price increases decrease real wealth and so people consume less in order
to increase their wealth through saving. As a result, an increase in the price level
decreases the aggregate quantity of goods and services demanded.
There are two substitution effects. The first is the intertemporal substitution effect: an
increase in the price level raises the interest rate because the amount of real loans banks
can make decreases. The higher interest rate leads consumers to decrease their
consumption expenditure and firms to decrease their investment spending. The second
substitution effect is the international price substitution effect: an increase in the U.S.
price level raises the price of U.S.-made goods relative to foreign-made goods. So people
and firms decrease the quantity of U.S.-made goods they purchase and increase the
quantity of foreign-made goods they purchase. So both substitution effects also lead to a
rise in the price level decreasing the aggregate quantity demanded.

8) What is the effect on the aggregate demand curve from an increase in the price level? In
particular, does the aggregate demand curve shift leftward or rightward?
Answer: When the price level increases, there is a movement along the aggregate demand curve.
The quantity of real GDP demanded decreases in response to an increase in the price
level. However, the aggregate demand curve does  not shift. Factors that change aggregate
demand and shift the aggregate demand curve are changes in the interest rate, in the
quantity of money, in government expenditure, in taxes, in the exchange rate, and in real
GDP in the rest of the world.

9) What are the substitution effects that affect aggregate demand?
Answer: There are two substitution effects that affect aggregate demand and help account for the
negative slope of the AD curve. First, an increase in the price level raises the interest rate,
which reduces the quantity of real GDP demanded. Second, an increase in the U.S. price
level raises the price of U.S. goods relative to foreign goods which also decreases the
quantity of U.S. real GDP demanded.

11) Give examples of factors that decrease aggregate demand. Which way does the aggregate
demand curve shift?
Answer: Anything that decreases aggregate spending decreases aggregate demand. A rise in the
interest rate, a decrease in the quantity of money, a decrease in government expenditure,
a tax hike, a rise in the exchange rate, and a decrease in real GDP in the rest of the world
all decrease aggregate demand. The aggregate demand curve shifts leftward.

12) What are fiscal and monetary policies? Do they have an immediate effect on the  AD curve or the
SAS curve?
Answer: Fiscal policy is defined as changes in government spending and taxation to affect the
level of economic activity. Monetary policy consists of changing interest rates and
changing the quantity of money in the economy in order to affect the level of economic
activity. Both policies have an impact on the AD curve.

13) What are the components of fiscal policy? Explain how fiscal policy affects aggregate demand.
Answer: Fiscal policy affects aggregate demand through government expenditure, transfer
payments and taxes. Because government purchases are a component of total spending, a
change in government expenditure directly changes aggregate demand. A change in
transfer payments changes disposable income which, in turn, changes consumption
expenditure and aggregate demand. Finally, taxes alter disposable income and thus
impact consumption expenditure and aggregate demand.

15) What two variables are determined in an aggregate supply-aggregate demand figure? Is the
slope of the short-run aggregate supply curve positive or negative? Is the slope of the aggregate
demand curve positive or negative?
Answer: The aggregate supply-aggregate demand framework determines the equilibrium price
level and equilibrium real GDP. The aggregate supply curve is positively sloped,
indicating that an increase in the price level increases the aggregate quantity of goods and
services supplied. The aggregate demand curve is negatively sloped, indicating that an
increase in the price level decreases the aggregate quantity of goods and services
demanded.

16) Explain the relationship of the long-run aggregate supply curve, the short-run aggregate
supply curve and the aggregate demand curve in determining a long -run and short-run
macroeconomic equilibrium.
Answer: Short-run macroeconomic equilibrium occurs when the quantity of GDP demanded
equals the quantity supplied, which is where the AD and SAS curves intersect. The
short-run equilibrium does not necessarily take place at full employment. The long-run
macroeconomic equilibrium occurs when real GDP equals potential GDP. This means
that the economy is on the LAS curve, where the AD and SAS curves both intersect the
LAS curve.

17) Assume the equilibrium price level is 140 and the equilibrium real GDP is $15 trillion. What
happens if the current price level equals 125?
Answer: The quantity of real GDP demanded is greater than the quantity of real GDP supplied.
The price level rises to 140 because of the excess aggregate demand and when the price
level reaches 140, macroeconomic equilibrium would be established.

19) What is the difference between a recessionary gap and an inflationary gap?
Answer: A recessionary gap exists when the economy is in a below full-employment equilibrium
when potential GDP exceeds real GDP. The recessionary gap is the amount by which
potential GDP exceeds real GDP. An inflationary gap occurs when the economy is in an
above full-employment equilibrium when real GDP exceeds potential GDP. In this case,
the inflationary gap is the difference between real GDP and potential GDP.

20) What happens if the economy is at its long-run equilibrium and aggregate demand increases?
Answer: The increase in aggregate demand means that the AD curve shifts rightward. Initially
short-run aggregate supply does not change, so the  SAS curve remains stationary. As a
result, the price level rises and real GDP increases. The economy is an above
full-employment equilibrium. Eventually, however, the tight labor market leads to a rise
in the money wage rate. When the money wage rate rises, short-run aggregate supply
decreases and the SAS curve shifts leftward. The price level rises and real GDP decreases.
In the long run, the short-run aggregate supply decreases so that real GDP returns to
potential level of GDP and the only effect is that the price level is permanently higher.

22) Compare the policy prescriptions of Keynesian, Classical, and Monetarist economists.
Answer: Keynesians believe that without assistance the economy would almost never be at full
employment. They prescribe activist fiscal and monetary policy to drive the economy to
full employment. Classical economists believe the economy is self-regulating and will
always tend towards full employment. Their main policy initiatives center on removing
tax created disincentives for growth. Monetarists call for low taxes and consistent money
growth because Monetarists believe that recessions are the result of fluctuations in the
quantity of money.

aggregate supply curve.
b) What are the short-run equilibrium real GDP and price level in Purpleland?
c) What is the long-run equilibrium real GDP?
d) Is Purplelandʹs short-run macroeconomic equilibrium a full-employment equilibrium,

e) Suppose aggregate demand increases by $150 billion. Plot the new aggregate demand

f) Is Purplelandʹs new short-run macroeconomic equilibrium a full-employment equilibrium,
below full-employment equilibrium, or above full-employment equilibrium? What is the
recessionary gap (if any)? What is the inflationary gap (if any)?
Answer:
a)
See the figure above. The aggregate demand curve is AD 0 .
Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education, Inc.Chapter 10   Aggregate Supply and Aggregate Demand   129
b) A short-run macroeconomic equilibrium occurs where the aggregate demand curve,
AD 0 , intersects the short-run aggregate supply curve, SAS. As the figure shows, the
short-run equilibrium real GDP is $600 billion, and the short-run equilibrium price level
is 100.
c) Long-run equilibrium real GDP equals potential GDP. So the long-run equilibrium
real GDP in Purpleland is $675 billion.
d) Purplelandʹs short-run macroeconomic equilibrium is a below full-employment
equilibrium because the short-run equilibrium GDP is less than potential GDP. The
amount by which potential GDP exceeds real GDP is a recessionary gap, so the
recessionary gap is $75 billion. An inflationary gap exists when real GDP is above
potential GDP, so there is no inflationary gap in Purpleland.
e) As the figure above shows, the aggregate demand curve shifts from  AD 0  to AD 1 . As
a result, real GDP increases from $600 billion to $675 billion, and the price level rises from
100 to 110.
f) Purplelandʹs new short-run macroeconomic equilibrium is a full-employment
equilibrium because the equilibrium real GDP equals the potential GDP. When real GDP
equals potential GDP, there is neither a recessionary gap nor an inflationary gap.

b) What are the short-run equilibrium real GDP and price level in Yellowland?
c) What is the long-run equilibrium real GDP?
d) Is Yellowlandʹs short-run macroeconomic equilibrium a full-employment equilibrium,

recessionary gap (if any)? What is the inflationary gap (if any)?
e) Suppose aggregate supply decreases by $150 billion. Plot the new aggregate supply curve.
How do real GDP and the price level change in the short run?
f) Is Yellowlandʹs new short-run macroeconomic equilibrium a full-employment equilibrium,
below full-employment equilibrium, or above full-employment equilibrium? What is the
recessionary gap (if any)? What is the inflationary gap (if any)?
Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education, Inc.130   Parkin · Macroeconomics, Tenth Edition
Answer:
a)
See the figure above. The short-run aggregate supply curve is SAS0 .
b) A short-run macroeconomic equilibrium occurs where the aggregate demand curve,
AD, intersects the short-run aggregate supply curve, SAS0 . As the figure shows, the
short-run equilibrium real GDP is $350 billion, and the short-run equilibrium price level
is 110.
c) Long-run equilibrium real GDP equals potential GDP. So the long-run equilibrium
real GDP in Yellowland is $300 billion.
d) Yellowlandʹs short-run macroeconomic equilibrium is an above full-employment
equilibrium because the short-run equilibrium GDP exceeds potential GDP. The amount
by which real GDP exceeds potential GDP is an inflationary gap. So the inflationary gap
is $50 billion. A recessionary gap exists when real GDP is below potential GDP. So there
is no recessionary gap in Yellowland.
e) As the figure above shows, the short-run aggregate supply curve shifts from SAS0  to
SAS1 . As a result, real GDP decreases from $350 billion to $300 billion, and the price level
rises from 110 to 120.
f) Yellowlandʹs new short-run macroeconomic equilibrium is a full-employment
equilibrium because the equilibrium real GDP equals the potential GDP. When real GDP
equals potential GDP, there is neither a recessionary gap nor an inflationary gap.

7  Essay Questions
1) List the four components of aggregate expenditure. Explain the two-way link with real GDP.
Answer: The four components of aggregate expenditure are consumption expenditure,
investment, government expenditure on goods and services, and net exports. These four
components sum to real GDP. The two-way link between these four parts and real GDP
exists through consumption expenditure and imports, both of which are influenced by
the level of real GDP. Specifically, an increase in real GDP increases these components of
aggregate expenditure and an increase in aggregate expenditure increases real GDP.

2) What is the consumption function? What factor leads to a movement along the consumption
function?
Answer: The consumption function is the relationship between disposable income and the amount
of consumption expenditure, other things remaining the same. A change in disposable
income results in a movement along the consumption function.

3) Please explain the relationship between consumption, disposable income and saving.
Answer: In general, the greater the level of disposable income the greater the level of consumption.
Therefore, as disposable income rises consumption rises. Any amount of disposable
income not spent, or consumed, is saved. Disposable income is split between
consumption and saving. Consumption, however, is not solely determined by disposable
income. In fact at low levels of disposable income consumption can be greater than
disposable income. This is true in the extreme when disposable income is zero and
consumption is greater than zero. At times when consumption is greater than disposable
income saving is negative. We are dissaving. On the other hand, if disposable income is
high enough, consumption can be less than disposable income. In this case we have
positive saving. Lastly, as disposable income rises, consumption rises but by less.

4) What is the difference between movements along the consumption function and shifts in the
consumption function? What factor or factors lead to movements along the consumption
function and what factor or factors lead to shifts in the consumption function?
Answer: The consumption function describes the relationship between disposable income and
consumption expenditure: If disposable income increases, consumption increases and if
disposable income decreases consumption decreases. Because the consumption function
is illustrated using disposable income along the horizontal axis, changes in disposable
income lead to movements along the consumption function. Changes in other factors that
affect consumption expenditure, such as the real interest rate, wealth, and expected future
income, shift the consumption function. Specifically, if the real interest rate falls, if wealth
increases, or if future income is expected to increase, the consumption function shifts
upward so that at any level of disposable income, consumption is greater than it
otherwise would have been.

5) List and explain factors that influence consumption expenditure.
Answer: Disposable income is an important factor that influences consumption expenditure. There
is a direct relationship between the two, so that an increase in disposable income leads to
an increase in consumption expenditure. There also are three other factors that influence
consumption expenditure: the real interest rate, the buying power of money, and
expected future disposable income. When the real interest rate falls, the buying power of
money increases, or expected future disposable income increases, consumption increases.
Alternatively, when the real interest rate rises, the buying power of money decreases, or
expected future income decreases, consumption expenditure decreases.

6) How is it possible for consumption expenditure to be positive even when disposable income is
zero?
Answer: Consumption expenditure can be positive when disposable income is zero because
people can ʺdissave,ʺ that is, they can use their past saving to finance current
consumption expenditure. Dissaving cannot occur indefinitely because eventually
peopleʹs savings will be dissipated.

where △ means ʺchange in.ʺ The MPC tells
income that is consumed, or MPC = 
△YD
what fraction of an increase in disposable income is spent on consumption. The MPC is
an important concept because it affects the multiplier: The larger the MPC, everything
else the same, the larger the multiplier.

8) What is the marginal propensity to consume? Can the marginal propensity to consume be
greater than 1?
Answer: The marginal propensity to consume is the change in consumption expenditure divided
by the change in disposable income that brought it about. The marginal propensity to
consume cannot be greater than 1. Indeed, it is less than 1 because people save part of an
increase in disposable income.

divided by the change in disposable income. The MPC, tells the proportion of any change
in disposable income spent on consumption expenditure. The marginal propensity to
consume is equal to the slope of the consumption function.

11) Discuss the link between real GDP and imports.
Answer: Imports are one of two components that are influenced by changes in U.S. real GDP and
so imports are referred to as an induced expenditure. Other things the same, an increase
in U.S. real GDP leads to an increase in U.S. imports. As U.S. income increases,
households purchase more domestic as well as more foreign goods and services.

12) What is the difference between induced and autonomous expenditure? Which components of
aggregate expenditure fall under which category?
Answer: Induced expenditure is expenditure that depends on the level of real GDP, so that when
real GDP changes, induced expenditure changes. Autonomous expenditure is
independent of the level of real GDP, so that when real GDP changes, autonomous
expenditure does not change. Consumption expenditure includes elements of both
autonomous and induced expenditure. So, too, do imports. However, investment,
government expenditure on goods and services, and exports are all autonomous
expenditures.

13) Define induced expenditure and autonomous expenditure. Which expenditure items are
induced expenditure and which are autonomous expenditure?
Answer: Induced expenditure is aggregate expenditure that changes as real GDP changes.
Consumption expenditure and imports respond to changes in real GDP, so they have
induced components. Autonomous expenditure is aggregate expenditure that does not
change as real GDP changes. Investment, government expenditure, and exports are
autonomous expenditures. Consumption expenditure also has an autonomous
component.

Answer: The sentence is incorrect along two dimensions. First, U.S., exports do not depend on U.S.
real GDP. Indeed, U.S. exports are part of autonomous spending. Second, because U.S.
exports do not depend on U.S. real GDP, they definitely do not increase when U.S. real

17) Explain the relationships between real GDP, aggregate planned expenditure, induced
expenditure, and unplanned investment.
Answer: All buyers in the economy make expenditure plans. Aggregate planned expenditure
equals the sum of these buying plans. Aggregate planned expenditure is divided into
four components: consumption expenditure, investment, government expenditure on
goods and services, and net exports. Investment, government expenditure, and exports
are autonomous expenditures because they do not vary with the level of real GDP.
Consumption expenditure and imports, however, are affected by the level of real GDP
and so are induced expenditures. If aggregate planned expenditure differs from real
GDP, not all planned expenditure can be carried out. In this situation, firmsʹ inventories
change in an unplanned manner. When aggregate planned expenditure is less that real
GDP, inventories increase beyond what was planned and when aggregate planned
expenditure is greater than real GDP, inventories decrease beyond what was planned.
Because changes in inventories are included in investment, when there are unplanned
changes in inventories there is unplanned investment.

18) At the equilibrium level of aggregate expenditure, what does aggregate planned expenditure
equal? What happens at other levels of real GDP to bring about an equilibrium?
Answer: At the equilibrium level of aggregate expenditure, aggregate planned expenditure is
equal to real GDP. At levels of real GDP where aggregate planned expenditure is greater
than real GDP, business inventories are less than their target levels. In this situation,
businesses increase their production, so output increases and real GDP increases. At
levels of real GDP where aggregate planned expenditure is less than real GDP, business
inventories are greater than their target levels. In this situation, businesses decrease their
production, so output decreases and real GDP decreases.

increase production in order to restore their inventories back to their planned levels.
When firms increase their production of goods and services, real GDP increases.

20) What is unplanned investment? How does it occur?
Answer: Unplanned investment occurs when inventories grow larger than planned. The difference
between the actual change in inventories and the planned change is unplanned
investment. Unplanned investment occurs when aggregate planned expenditure is less
than real GDP so firms sell less output than they had planned.

21) If real GDP exceeds aggregate planned expenditure, what happens to firmʹs unplanned
inventories?
Answer: If real GDP exceeds aggregate planned expenditure, firms are producing more goods and
services than households, firms, and governments are planning to buy. As a result, firms
will not be able to sell all of their production. The unsold amounts will wind up in their
inventories and so unplanned inventory increases.

Answer: If inventories are above their target levels, that is, more than planned so there is an
unplanned increase in inventories, firms decrease their production. As a result, GDP
decreases. Conversely, if inventories are below their target levels, that is, less than
planned so there is an unplanned decrease in inventories, firms increase their production.
In this case, GDP increases.

24) Explain the relationship between real GDP and aggregate planned expenditure,  AE. What
change to inventories takes place when the two are not equal?
Answer: If the GDP and aggregate planned expenditure are equal, then there is an equilibrium.
But if aggregate planned expenditure is not equal to real GDP, the economy is out of
equilibrium. If aggregate planned expenditure is greater than real GDP, then households,
firms, and governments plan to buy more goods and services than firms are producing.
Firms meet the extra demand by allowing their inventories to decrease. The decrease is
unplanned on the part of firms. So when aggregate planned expenditure exceeds real
GDP, there is an unplanned decrease in inventories. Similarly, if aggregate planned
expenditure is less than real GDP, households, firms, and governments plan to buy less
than firms produce and so there is an unplanned increase in firmsʹ inventories.

26) Suppose that firms find that their inventories are less than planned. In this case, what is the
initial relationship between aggregate planned expenditure and real GDP? Using the aggregate
expenditure model, what adjustments, if any, take place?
Answer: If inventories are less than planned, aggregate planned expenditure exceeds real GDP. In
order to restore their inventories to their desired levels, firms will increase their
production. As a result, real GDP increases. Inventories remain less than planned and real
GDP continues to increase until eventually real GDP reaches its equilibrium level, at
which point actual and planned inventories are equal.

27) How does the economy adjust so that aggregate planned expenditure equals real GDP?
Answer: Equilibrium occurs when real GDP equals the aggregate planned expenditure so that
unplanned inventory change is zero. The unplanned changes to inventory are the key
signal that induces firms to change their production and drive the economy to its
equilibrium. For example, if aggregate planned expenditure is greater than real GDP,
firms find their inventory levels falling. This change is an unplanned reduction so firms
respond by increasing production and, as a result, real GDP and disposable income
increase. The increase in real GDP moves the economy closer to equilibrium but the
increase in disposable income leads to an increase in induced aggregate expenditures.
However the increase in induced aggregate expenditures is less than the increase in real
GDP, so the difference between aggregate planned expenditure and real GDP shrinks. As
long as there is unplanned decreases in inventories, firms continue to increase their
production so that real GDP continues to increase. Ultimately equilibrium is reached
when unplanned inventory changes are zero and so aggregate planned expenditures
equal real GDP.

28) A country reports that it has an unplanned inventory increase of $1.0 trillion. Discuss how the
economy adjusts until it reaches an unplanned inventory change of $0.0 trillion.
Answer: When unplanned inventory changes are positive, real GDP exceeds aggregate planned

real GDP decreases. Firms continue to decrease production until real GDP equals
aggregate planned expenditures and unplanned inventory changes equal zero.

29) Explain the basic idea of the expenditure multiplier and the role consumers play in determining
its magnitude.
Answer: The basic idea of the multiplier is that any increase in expenditure will increase real GDP
by a larger (a multiple) amount. The magnitude of the multiplier basically depends on
how strongly consumers respond to additional income. Any initial increase in
expenditure increases aggregate expenditure, which leads to more production and an
increase in real GDP and income. Thus an increase, say in investment, generates an
increase in income and this increase, in turn, induces an increase in consumption
expenditure. The second round, the increase in consumption expenditure, is the result of
the first round, the increase in investment. But the story does not stop with just two
rounds. The initial increase in expenditure sets off a chain of increases because the second
round increase in consumption leads to yet another increase in GDP and income. As a
result of this next increase in income, consumption expenditure increases another time
and a third round of expenditure increases occurs. The final result of all the rounds has
real GDP increasing many fold compared to the initial increase in investment.

30) Explain why the multiplier is greater than 1.
Answer: The multiplier is greater than 1 because increases in real GDP induce further increases in
expenditure. For instance, suppose Intel spends $500 million building a new factory. As a
result, the disposable income of the workers constructing the factory increase. With the
increase in their disposable income, these workers increase their consumption
expenditure. Perhaps they all purchase new Ford SUVs. Ford must employ additional
workers to build these SUVs, and so these workersʹ incomes increase. Possibly the Ford
workers all buy new stoves. Hence the initial increase in Intelʹs investment has induced
additional consumption expenditure upon SUVs and stoves. And the process wonʹt stop
with the stoves because the workers who make the stoves will increase their consumption
expenditure. All of the added consumption expenditure makes the multiplier greater
than 1.

Answer: Equilibrium expenditure will increase by more than $100 million because of the

aggregate expenditure because the initial increase in expenditure increases income,
which, in turn, causes further increases in expenditure and income.

Answer: The multiplier equals 1/(1 - MPC), so the multiplier equals 1/(1 - 0.9) = 1/(0.1) = 10. With
a multiplier of 10, a $100 billion increase in investment results in a (10) × ($100 billion) =

39) Discuss how the marginal propensity to consume, imports, and income tax rates influence the
multiplier.
Answer: The simple multiplier, in an economy with no imports or income taxes, is 1/(1  - MPC),
where MPC is the marginal propensity to consume. The MPC measures how much
consumption changes when disposable income changes. The larger is the MPC, the larger
is the multiplier. Both the taxes and imports decrease the size of the multiplier because
both taxes and imports ʺdivertʺ changes in GDP from consumption expenditure on
domestic goods and services. The larger the income tax rate and the larger the marginal
propensity to import, the smaller the multiplier. The larger the income tax rate, the
smaller the change in disposable income from any change in GDP and, as a result, the
smaller than induced change in consumption expenditure. The larger the marginal
propensity to import, the more increased consumption expenditure falls on imported
goods and so the smaller the effect on domestically produced goods and services.

40) List and explain factors that determine the size of the multiplier in the aggregate expenditure
model when prices are constant.
Answer: The size of the multiplier depends on three factors: the marginal propensity to consume,
the marginal propensity to import, and the income tax rate. The larger the marginal
propensity to import and the larger the tax rate, the smaller the multiplier. These two
factors decrease the size of the multiplier because imports reduce spending on U.S.
produced products and income taxes reduce the impact of a change in real GDP on
consumption expenditure. On the other hand, the larger the marginal propensity to
consume, the larger the multiplier.

41) How does the concept of the multiplier help explain business cycle turning points?
Answer: Business cycle turning points are the point in the business cycle during which the
economy either goes from expansion to recession, or recession to expansion. If the
economy is at a peak, an expansion is turning into a recession. At this point, aggregate
planned expenditures decrease because of a decrease in an autonomous component of
expenditure. Real GDP is now greater than aggregate planned expenditure. Inventories
rise and firms respond to rising inventories by cutting production, so that real GDP
decreases. The multiplier process works and consumption falls by a multiple of the
decrease in real GDP. The economy moves into recession. Just the reverse occurs at a
trough. At a trough the economy moves from a recession to an expansion. Expansions
start as an increase in an autonomous component of aggregate expenditure. This increase
boosts aggregate planned expenditures so that it exceeds real GDP. Inventories
unexpectedly fall. Firms respond by raising their production, so that real GDP and
disposable income increase. Induced expenditure rises by more because of the multiplier
effect and so the expansion has begun.

42) Discuss the relationship between the business cycle and changes in autonomous expenditures.
Answer: An increase in autonomous expenditure increases aggregate planned expenditure. At the
moment the economy turns the corner into expansion, aggregate planned expenditure
exceeds real GDP. Firmsʹ inventories become less than their target levels, so firms
increase production in order to build up their inventories. The reverse happens when a
recession begins. A decrease in autonomous expenditure decreases aggregate planned
expenditure. When the economy turns the corner into recession, aggregate planned
expenditure is less than real GDP. As a result firmsʹ inventories exceed their target levels,
and so firms decrease production in order to decrease their inventories.

43) ʺWhen the price level increases, aggregate planned expenditure increases and equilibrium
expenditure increases.ʺ Is the preceding statement correct or incorrect? Briefly explain your
answer.
Answer: The statement is incorrect. An increase in the price level decreases aggregate planned
expenditure because the purchasing power of money falls, the real interest rises, and the
price of imports become less expensive relative to domestically produced goods. Because
aggregate planned expenditure decreases, equilibrium expenditure decreases.

45) An increase in the price level shifts the aggregate expenditure curve downward and results in a
movement along the aggregate demand curve. Why does an increase in the price level result in
a shift in the aggregate expenditure curve rather than a movement along it?
Answer: The increase in the price level shifts the aggregate expenditure curve because the
aggregate expenditure curve plots expenditure against real GDP. In other words, the
curve shows how aggregate planned expenditure changes when real GDP changes. Thus
a change in real GDP results in a movement along the aggregate expenditure curve. But
the effect from an increase in the price level creates a shift in the curve because at any
level of real GDP, a higher price level means a lower level of expenditure. Because the
effect of the higher price level applies at all levels of real GDP, the aggregate expenditure
curve shifts downward.

aggregate expenditure equals GDP. As a result, firmsʹ inventories equal planned
inventories so firms have no incentive to either increase or decrease production.

6) The slope of the AE curve is .80. What is the multiplier? Everything else the same, by how much
does equilibrium aggregate expenditure increase if
a) exports increase from $1.75 trillion to $2.25 trillion.
b) government expenditure on goods and services decrease from $2.0 trillion to $1.8 trillion.
c) investment increases from $1.2 trillion to $2.3 trillion.
Answer: a) The change in equilibrium aggregate expenditure equals the multiplier times the
change in autonomous expenditure, which is $0.5 trillion. So the change in equilibrium
expenditure is 5 × ($0.5 trillion) = $2.5 trillion.
b) The change in equilibrium aggregate expenditure equals the multiplier times the
change in autonomous expenditure, which is -$0.2 trillion, that is, government
expenditure decreases by $0.2 trillion. So the change in equilibrium expenditure is 5  ×
(-$0.2 trillion) = -$1.0 billion.
c) The change in equilibrium aggregate expenditure equals the multiplier times the
change in autonomous expenditure, which is $1.1 trillion. So the change in equilibrium
expenditure is 5 × ($1.1 trillion) = $5.5 trillion.

10  Extended Problems
1) In the country of Midland, autonomous consumption expenditure is $60 million, and the
marginal propensity to consume is 0.6. Investment is $110 million, government expenditure is
$70 million, and there are no income taxes. Investment and government expenditure are
constantthey do not vary with income. The nation does not trade with the rest of the world.
a) Draw the aggregate expenditure curve.
b) What is the autonomous aggregate expenditure?
c) What is the size of the multiplier in Midlandʹs economy?
d) What is aggregate planned expenditure and what is happening to inventories when real
GDP is $800 million?
e) What is the economyʹs equilibrium aggregate expenditure?
Answer:
a) See the figure above. Because the nation does not trade with the rest of the world, net
exports are zero. When net exports are zero, aggregate expenditure, or  AE, is given by
AE = C + I + G. Consumption equals $60 million plus 0.6 of income, so the consumption
function is C = $60 million + 0.6Y, where $60 million is autonomous consumption, 0.60 is
the marginal propensity to consume, and Y is real GDP which equals real income. Using
the formula in the equation for aggregate expenditure gives
AE = $60 million + 0.6Y + $110 million + $70 million, so the formula for aggregate
expenditure is AE = $240 million + 0.6Y.
b) Autonomous expenditure is expenditure that does not vary with real GDP; it is the
amount of aggregate expenditure when real GDP equals zero. In Midland, if  Y = 0,
AE = $240 + 0.6 × 0, so autonomous expenditure is $240 million, shown by point  A in the
figure above.
c) The multiplier is the amount by which a change in autonomous expenditure is
multiplied to determine the change in equilibrium expenditure and real GDP. The
multiplier equals 1/(1 - MPC). So in Midland, the multiplier is 1/(1 - 0.6) = 2.5.
d) When real GDP is $800 million, aggregate planned expenditure, AE, equals
$240 + 0.6 × $800 million, which is $720 million. This level of aggregate planned
expenditure is point B in the figure above. Because this level of aggregate planned
expenditures is less than real GDP, point C in the figure, inventories increase.
Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education, Inc.260   Parkin · Macroeconomics, Tenth Edition
e) Equilibrium expenditure is the level of aggregate expenditure that occurs when
aggregate planned expenditure, AE, equals real GDP. Midlandʹs equilibrium expenditure
is at point E in the figure, when real GDP and aggregate expenditure equal $600 million.
Equilibrium expenditure also can be calculated by solving the equation
Y = $240 million + 0.6Y for Y. Start by subtracting 0.6Y from both sides to give
0.4Y = $240 million. Then divide both sides by 0.4 to obtain Y = $240 million/0.4, so that Y,
which is real GDP, equals $600 million.

2) In the economy of St. Maynard Island, autonomous consumption expenditure is $185 million,
and the marginal propensity to consume is 0.75. Investment is $150 million, government
expenditure is $100 million, and net taxes are $80 million. Investment, government expenditure,
and taxes are constantthey do not vary with income. The island does not trade with the rest of
the world.
a) Draw the aggregate expenditure curve.
b) What is the islandʹs autonomous aggregate expenditure?
c) What is the size of the multiplier in St. Maynard Islandʹs economy?
d) What is the islandʹs aggregate planned expenditure and what is happening to inventories
when real GDP is $1,100 million?
e) What is the economyʹs equilibrium aggregate expenditure?
Answer:
a) See the figure above. Because the island does not trade with the rest of the world, net
exports are zero. When net exports are zero, aggregate expenditure, or  AE, is given by
AE = C + I + G. Consumption equals $185 million plus 0.75 of disposable income, so the
consumption function is C = $185 million + 0.75(Y - T), where $185 million is
autonomous consumption, 0.75 is the marginal propensity to consume, and  Y - T is
disposable income, real income minus net taxes. (Real income also equals real GDP.)
Because net taxes are constant, the consumption function is
C = $185 million + 0.75(Y - $80 million). Using the formula in the equation for aggregate
Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education, Inc.Chapter 11   Expenditure Multipliers: The Keynesian Model    261
expenditure gives AE = $185 million + 0.75(Y - $80 million) + $150 million + $100 million,
so aggregate expenditure is given by AE = $375 million + 0.75Y.
b) Autonomous expenditure is expenditure that does not vary with real GDP; it is the
level of aggregate expenditure if real GDP were equal to zero. In the economy of St.
Maynard Island, if Y = 0, AE = $375 million + 0.75 ( 0, so autonomous expenditure is $375
million, which is point A in the figure above.
c) The multiplier is the amount by which a change in autonomous expenditure is
multiplied to determine the change in equilibrium expenditure and real GDP. The
multiplier equals 1/(1 - slope of AE curve). The slope of the AE curve is 0.75, so in the
economy of St. Maynard Island, the multiplier is 1/(1 - 0.75) = 4.
d) When real GDP is $1,100 million, aggregate planned expenditure,  AE, equals
$375 million + 0.75 × $1,100 million, which is $1,200 million. This level of aggregate
planned expenditure is point B in the figure above. Because this level of aggregate
planned expenditures exceeds real GDP, point C in the figure, inventories decrease.
e) Equilibrium expenditure is the level of aggregate expenditure that occurs when
aggregate planned expenditure, AE, equals real GDP. In the economy of St. Maynard
Island equilibrium is at point E in the figure, when real GDP and aggregate expenditure
equal $1,500 million. Equilibrium expenditure also can be calculated by solving the
equation Y = $375 million + 0.75Y for Y. Start by subtracting 0.75Y from both sides to give
0.25Y  = $375 million. Then divide both sides by 0.25 to obtain  Y = $375 million/0.25, so
that Y, which is real GDP, equals $1,500 million.

3) In the economy of Keynesian Island, autonomous consumption expenditure is $50 million, and
the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8. Investment is $160 million, government expenditure
is $190 million, and net taxes are $250 million. Investment, government purchases, and taxes are
constantthey do not vary with income. The island does not trade with the rest of the world.
a) Draw the aggregate expenditure curve.
b) What is equilibrium real GDP for Keynesian Island?
c) What is the size of the multiplier in Keynesian Islandʹs economy?
d) If the government increases its purchases by $200 million, what will be the change in the
economyʹs equilibrium real GDP?
Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education, Inc.262   Parkin · Macroeconomics, Tenth Edition
Answer:
a)
See the figure above. The aggregate expenditure line is AE0. Because the island does
not trade with the rest of the world, net exports are zero. When net exports are zero,
aggregate expenditure, is given by AE = C + I + G. Consumption equals $50 million plus
0.8 of disposable income, so the consumption function is C = $50 million + 0.8(Y - T),
where $50 million is autonomous consumption, 0.8 is the marginal propensity to
consume, and Y - T is disposable income, real income minus net taxes. (Real income also
equals real GDP.) Because net taxes are constant, the consumption function is
C = $50 million + 08(Y - $250 million). Using the formula in the equation for aggregate
expenditure gives AE = $50 million + 0.8(Y - $250 million) + $160 million + $190 million,
so aggregate expenditure is given by AE = $200 million + 0.8Y.
b) Equilibrium expenditure is the level of aggregate expenditure that occurs when
aggregate planned expenditure, AE, equals real GDP. In the economy of Keynesian Island
equilibrium is at point E in the figure, when real GDP and aggregate expenditure equal
$1,000 million. Equilibrium expenditure also can be calculated by solving the equation
Y = $200 million + 0.8Y for Y. Start by subtracting 0.8Y from both sides to give
0.2Y = $200 million. Then divide both sides by 0.2 to obtain Y = $200 million/0.2, so that Y,
which is real GDP, equals $1,000 million.
c) The multiplier is the amount by which a change in autonomous expenditure is
multiplied to determine the change in equilibrium expenditure and real GDP. The
multiplier equals 1/(1 - slope of the AE curve). The slope of the AE curve is 0.80, so in the
economy of Keynesian Island, the multiplier is 1/(1 - 0.8) = 5.
d) If the government increases its expenditure by $200 million, the aggregate
expenditure curve shifts up by the amount of additional purchases to the aggregate
expenditure line AE1 . (The new formula for aggregate expenditure is
AE = $400 million + 0.8Y.) The economyʹs equilibrium real GDP increases by the amount
of the additional expenditure multiplied by the multiplier. So the increase in real GDP is
$200 million × 5, which equals $1,000 million. So the new equilibrium level of real GDP is
$2,000 million, point C in the figure above.

2) What are sources that can start a demand-pull inflation?
Answer: Demand-pull inflation starts with an increase in aggregate demand. This increase can
arise by increases in the quantity of money, increases in government expenditure, or
increases in net exports because any of these three shift increase aggregate demand and
shift the AD curve rightward. The increase in aggregate demand leads to a higher price
level and, temporarily, a higher level of real GDP. If the economy began at full
employment, then temporarily the level of real GDP will be above potential. In the long
run, however, the money wage rate rises to offset the increase in the price level, so the
short-run aggregate supply decreases and the  SAS curve shifts leftward. The decrease in
aggregate supply also raises the price level. So the only way the inflation can continue is
if aggregate demand continues to increase.

3) Describe how a demand-pull inflation can occur.
Answer: Demand-pull inflation starts from an initial increase in aggregate demand. But if this
increase is a one-time only event, the result is a higher price level but not inflation. For
inflation to occur, aggregate demand needs to continue to increase. Continuing increases
in the quantity of money result in continuing increases in aggregate demand, so
monetary growth is necessary for a demand-pull inflation.

4) What was the U.S. experience with demand pull inflation during the 1960s and early 1970s?
Answer: The United States experienced demand pull inflation notably during the late 1960s.
Government spending increased enormously during the decade because of spending on
the Vietnam War and on social programs related to the Great Society of Lyndon Johnson.
These increases in spending were matched by increases in the quantity of money. The  AD
curve shifted rightward, driving prices higher. The decade had begun with inflation of 2
percent per year. By the end of the decade the rate was 5 percent and would reach 10
percent by 1975.

5) What is a cost-push inflation?
Answer: A cost-push inflation is an inflation that starts as a result of an increase in costs. Money
wage rates and the cost of raw materials are the main sources of cost-push inflation.

6) What factors can start a cost-push inflation? What must the Fedʹs response be for the inflation to
continue?
Answer: Cost push inflation starts with a decrease in the short-run aggregate supply, that is, a
leftward shift of the SAS curve. The decrease in short-run aggregate supply can be the
result of an increase in the money wage rate or an increase in the money price of other
raw materials. In either instance firmsʹ costs have risen and they respond by decreasing
production, which decreases the short-run aggregate supply. The dilemma for the Fed is
that the decreases in short-run aggregate supply means that real GDP falls below
potential GDP and the price level rises. If the Fed responds by increasing the quantity of
money in order to increase aggregate demand and move real GDP back to potential GDP,
the price level will rise still higher. And if the initial agent that raised costs responds to
the higher price level by again raising its costs, then a cost -push inflation might well
occur.

7) What is the Phillips curve? Discuss both the short-run and long-run Phillips curve.
Answer: In general, a Phillips curve shows a relationship between the inflation rate and the
unemployment rate. There is a short-run Phillips curve and a long-run Phillips curve.
Moving along a short-run Phillips curve, expected inflation and the natural
unemployment rate are constant. The short-run Phillips curve shows the relationship
between the inflation rate and unemployment rate: a higher inflation rate results in a
lower unemployment rate. The long-run Phillips curve shows the relationship between
the inflation rate and unemployment rate when the inflation rate equals the expected
inflation rate. Moving along the long-run Phillips curve there is no tradeoff between the
inflation rate and the unemployment rate: a higher inflation rate has no effect on
unemployment rate, which remains equal to the natural unemployment rate.

9) Define and describe the short-run Phillips curve.
Answer: The short-run Phillips curve shows the relationship between the inflation rate and the
unemployment rate when the natural unemployment rate and the expected inflation rate
do not change. The short-run Phillips curve is downward sloping, indicating that there is
a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment: inflation can be lowered only at the cost
of higher unemployment and unemployment can be lowered only at the cost of higher
inflation.

11) What does the short-run Phillips curve indicate about the relationship between inflation and
unemployment?
Answer: Because the slope of the short-run Phillips curve is negative, the short-run Phillips curve
indicates that a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment exists. Lower inflation can
be obtained, but the price is higher unemployment. Similarly, lower unemployment is
possible but the price is higher inflation.

13) If the short-run Phillips curve shifts rightward, what happens to the relationship between
inflation and unemployment? If the short-run Phillips curve shifts leftward, what happens to
the relationship between inflation and unemployment?
Answer: A rightward shift of the short-run Phillips curve worsens the tradeoff between inflation
and unemployment. With the rightward shift, a given level of inflation is now associated
with a higher unemployment rate, or stated another way, a given unemployment rate is
now associated with a higher inflation rate. A leftward shift of the short -run Phillips
curve improves the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. With the leftward
shift, a given level of inflation is now associated with a lower unemployment rate, or
stated another way, a given unemployment rate is now associated with a lower inflation
rate.

14) ʺAs the economy moves upward along its short -run aggregate supply curve, the economy also
moves upward along its short-run Phillips curve.ʺ Is the previous statement correct or
incorrect? Briefly explain your answer.
Answer: The statement is correct. As the economy moves upward along its short-run aggregate
supply curve, the price level rises so that there is inflation. And as the economy moves
upward along its short-run aggregate supply curve, real GDP increases so that the
unemployment rate decreases. So, moving upward along the short -run aggregate supply
curve is associated with inflation and lower unemployment, which is what we see when
we move along the short-run Phillips curve.

15) Discuss the relationship between the short-run aggregate supply curve and the short-run
Phillips curve.
Answer: The short-run Phillips curve and the short-run aggregate supply curve arise because the
money wage rate does not change in the short run. When the price level increases, the
inflation rate is positive. And when the price level increases, the money wage rate does
not change, so the real wage rate declines. As a result of the lower real wage rate, the
quantity of labor employed increases so that the quantity of real GDP increases and the
unemployment rate decreases. Therefore the higher price level is associated with an
increase in real GDP and a higher inflation rate is associated with a decrease in
unemployment.

16) Explain how the expected inflation rate affects the short-run Phillips curve. Be sure to mention
the role played by the money wage rate.
Answer: When the expected inflation rate falls, the short-run Phillips curve shifts downward and
when the expected inflation rate rises, the short-run Phillips curve shifts upward. To see
why the expected inflation rate affects the short-run Phillips curve, the key is that the
expected inflation rate affects the money wage rate. Suppose the expected inflation rate
increases. As a result, labor contracts will now specify higher money wage rates in the
present and in the future. In turn, the higher the money wage rates, the more the
aggregate supply decreases. And, the more the aggregate supply decreases, the lower the
level of employment and the higher the level of unemployment. Therefore for a given
price level and inflation rate, an increase in the expected inflation rate increases the
unemployment rate, which means that the short-run Phillips curve shifts higher.

19) In the long run, what is the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment? Explain your answer
using Phillips curve analysis.
Answer: In the long run, there is no tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. In particular,
in the long run, changes in the inflation rate have no effect on the unemployment rate.
The long-run Phillips curve is vertical, thereby showing that in the long run, any inflation
rate can occur but in the long run the unemployment rate will equal the natural
unemployment rate.

20) Distinguish between the short-run and long-run Phillips curves.
Answer: The long-run Phillips curve shows the relationship between inflation and unemployment
when the unemployment rate equals the natural rate and the inflation rate equals the
expected inflation rate. There is no long-run tradeoff between inflation and
unemployment. The short-run Phillips curve, however, shows the relationship between
the inflation rate and the unemployment rate when the natural unemployment rate and
the expected inflation rate do not change. The short-run Phillips curve is downward
sloping, so that it shows a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.

21) Explain how the short-run and long-run Phillips curves are related.
Answer: The short-run Phillips curve is the relationship between the inflation rate and the
unemployment rate when the natural unemployment rate and the expected inflation rate
remain constant. The long-run Phillips curve is the relationship between the inflation rate
and the unemployment rate when the economy is at full employment. The short-run
Phillips curve is downward sloping, indicating that if the expected inflation rate and
natural unemployment rate do not change, a higher inflation rate decreases the
unemployment rate. The long-run Phillips curve is a vertical line illustrating that in the
long run, the economy at full employment can have any inflation rate. The short -run
Phillips curve intersects the long-run Phillips curve at the expected inflation rate. A
change in the expected inflation rate shifts the short -run Phillips curve but has no effect
on the long-run Phillips curve. An increase in the natural unemployment rate shifts both
the short-run and the long-run Phillips curve.

Answer: When the expected inflation rate changes, the short-run Phillips curve shifts but the

increases, the short-run Phillips curve shifts upward and if the expected inflation rate
decreases, the short-run Phillips curve shifts downward.

23) When the natural unemployment rate changes, what happens to the short-run Phillips curve?
To the long-run Phillips curve?
Answer: When the natural unemployment rate changes, both the short-run Phillips curve and the

curves shift rightward; if the natural unemployment rate decreases, both Phillips curves
shift leftward.

24) Using the Phillips curves, what are the short-run and long-run effects of a decrease in the
inflation rate?
Answer: In the short run, there is first a downward movement along the short-run Phillips curve
as the inflation rate falls and the unemployment rate increases. In the long run, however,
the expected inflation rate falls and the short-run Phillips curve shifts downward.
Therefore in the long run the inflation rate remains low and the unemployment rate
returns to the natural unemployment rate.

27) Compare and contrast the Keynesian and Monetarist business cycle theories.
Answer: Both theories are centered about changes in aggregate demand as the central cause of the
business cycle. Keynesianʹs use the concept of ʹanimal spiritsʹ and the inability to forecast
the future as the factor that leads to changes in investment. Monetarists assert that
changes in the growth rate of the quantity of money is the factor that leads to business
cycles. As for the adjustment following the initial shock of a change in the level of
investment, both theories envision a multiplier effect. This effect causes a greater change
in aggregate demand (and hence real GDP) than would occur strictly as a result of the
initial change in real GDP. Both theories also believe that sticky wages limit the ability of
the money wage rate to adjust to changes in aggregate demand.

31) What is the impulse that leads to business cycle in the real business cycle, RBC, theory?
Answer: The real business cycle theory focuses on changes in the growth rate of productivity as
the main source of economic fluctuations. Furthermore, the RBC theory views these
changes as random and mainly as a result of changes in the rate of technological change.
It asserts that most of the time technological change is steady, allowing for productivity to
grow at a moderate pace. Occasionally productivity growth speeds up or slows down. If
it speeds up, an expansion can be triggered while if it slows down a recession can result.

32) What is the intertemporal substitution effect and what role does it play in the real business cycle
model?
Answer: The intertemporal substitution effect is the idea that people choose when they will work
by comparing the real wage rate they receive this year to the real wage rate next year,
taking into account the real interest rate. Basically, employees compare how much they
would have earned if they worked this year (and received the real wage rate) and then
saved this amount (and thereby increased the amount by the real interest rate) to the real
interest rate they would earn by working next year. This effect plays a key role in the real
business cycle theory because it means that the supply of labor changes when the real
interest rate changes. For instance, as the economy heads into a recession with investment
demand decreasing, the decrease in investment demand lowers the real interest rate, so
the intertemporal substitution effect decreases the supply of labor and hence
employment. As a result, potential GDP decreases.

33) What are criticisms of the real business cycle theory?
Answer: Four criticisms of the real business cycle theory are frequently made. First is the criticism
that money wage rates are sticky, whereas the real business cycle theory assumes they are
flexible. Second is the assertion that intertemporal substitution is too weak to account for
large fluctuations in employment. Third is the criticism that technology shocks are
implausible as an impulse that causes a business cycle. Fourth is the comment is that
productivity shocks, as measured, are correlated with factors that change aggregate
demand and so are the result of the business cycle not a cause of the business cycle.

34) How do defenders of the real business cycle theory, (RBC theory) respond to critics of the
theory?
Answer: The defenders of the real business cycle theory state that the theory works because it
accurately describes the real-life experiences of both growth and the cyclical nature of
growth. The theory is also consistent with much microeconomic evidence about labor
supply, labor demand and investment demand decisions. They believe that although the
quantity of money is correlated with real GDP, real GDP changes cause the changes in the
quantity of money. Lastly, RBC theory proponents assert that the theory is important
because it points out that business cycles might be a normal state of affairs, which
suggests that government attempts to dampen them are futile.

1) Suppose the natural unemployment rate is 4 percent and the expected inflation rate is 6 percent.
In the above figure, illustrate the long-run Phillips curve. What does the long-run Phillips curve
reveal abut the long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment?
Answer:
The long-run Phillips curve is illustrated in the above figure. It is vertical at the natural
unemployment rate. The fact that the long-run Phillips curve is vertical means that in the
long run there is no tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. In other words, in the
long run higher inflation does not decrease unemployment nor does low inflation
increase unemployment.

8  Extended Problems
1) The figure above shows the initial aggregate demand curve,  AD 0 , the initial short-run
aggregate supply curve, SAS0 , and the long-run aggregate supply curve, LAS. The points in the
figure show possible combinations of real GDP and the price level at which the economy of
Atlantia is in macroeconomic equilibrium. The economy is initially at point  A. Then, the
government increases its expenditure on goods and services. Draw the new aggregate demand
and short-run aggregate supply curves in the figure to show the effects of this event on
Atlantiaʹs real GDP and price level.
a) What happens to Atlantiaʹs potential GDP?
b) In the short run, what happens to aggregate supply and aggregate demand?
c) What are the new short-run equilibrium real GDP and price level?
d) In the long run, what happens to the short-run aggregate supply and aggregate demand?
e) What are the new long-run equilibrium real GDP and price level?
Answer: a) Atlantiaʹs potential GDP is not affected. Potential GDP depends on the economyʹs
factors of production and available technology, not on aggregate spending.
Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education, Inc.Chapter 12   U.S. Inflation, Unemployment, and Business Cycle   381
b) See the figure above. The increase in government expenditure increases aggregate
demand. The aggregate demand curve shifts from AD 0  to AD 1 . Because there is no
change in potential GDP and no change in the money wage rate, short run aggregate
supply is not affected. The short-run aggregate supply curve remains at SAS0 .
c) In the short run the economy is at point B, where real GDP is $400 million and the
price level is 105.
d) Because at point B real GDP is above potential GDP, unemployment is less than the
natural rate so the tight conditions in the labor market means that the money wage rate
begins to rise. As it does, short-run aggregate supply decreases. The short-run aggregate
supply curve shifts from SAS0  to SAS1 . Because nothing further affects aggregate
demand, the aggregate demand curve remains at AD 1 .
e) In the long run the economy is at point D, where real GDP is $300 million and the
price level is 115.

2) The figure above shows the initial aggregate demand curve,  AD 0 , the initial short-run
aggregate supply curve, SAS0 , and the long-run aggregate supply curve, LAS. The points in the
figure show possible combinations of real GDP and the price level at which the economy of
Atlantia is in macroeconomic equilibrium. The economy is initially at point  A. Atlantiaʹs Central
Bank then increases the quantity of money year after year. Draw the necessary curves in the
figure to show the effects of this on Atlantiaʹs real GDP and price level.
a) What happens to Atlantiaʹs potential GDP?
b) In the short run, what happens to aggregate supply and aggregate demand?
c) What are the new short-run equilibrium real GDP and price level?
d) In the long run, what happens to aggregate supply and aggregate demand?
e) In the long run, what process is unfolding?
Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education, Inc.382   Parkin · Macroeconomics, Tenth Edition
Answer: a) Atlantiaʹs potential GDP is not affected. Potential GDP depends on the economyʹs
factors of production and available technology, not on monetary factors.
b) See the figure above. The increase in the quantity of money lowers the interest rate
and increases aggregate demand. The aggregate demand curve shifts rightward from
AD 0  to AD 1 . Because there is no change in potential GDP and no change in the money
wage rate, the short-run aggregate supply is not affected. The short-run aggregate
supply curve remains at SAS0 .
c) In the short run the economy is at point B, where real GDP is $400 million and the
price level is 105.
d) Because at point B real GDP exceeds potential GDP, unemployment is less than the
natural rate so the tight conditions in the labor market means that the money wage rate
begins to rise. As it does, short-run aggregate supply decreases. The short-run aggregate
supply curve shifts from SAS0  to SAS1 , bringing the economy to point D. But the Central
Bank increases the quantity of money again, and aggregate demand continues to
increase. The aggregate demand curve shifts rightward to AD 2 . The economy moves to
point G, so that the price level rises still more to 120 and real GDP again exceeds potential
GDP at $400 million. The money wage rate rises once again, further decreasing short -run
aggregate supply. The short-run aggregate supply curve shifts from SAS1  to SAS2 ,
bringing the economy to point F. As the quantity of money continues to grow, aggregate
demand continues to increase and short-run aggregate supply continues to decrease.
e) In the long run, the price level rises continuously as the economy moves from point  A
to point B to point D to point G to point F and so on. An ongoing demand-pull inflation
process is the result.

3) The figure above shows the initial aggregate demand curve,  AD 0 , the initial short-run
aggregate supply curve, SAS0 , and the long-run aggregate supply curve, LAS. The points in the
figure show possible combinations of real GDP and the price level at which the economy of
Atlantia is in macroeconomic equilibrium. The economy is initially at point  A. Then, Atlantiaʹs
oil producers form a price-fixing organization and increase the price of oil. Suppose that
potential GDP does not change and that Atlantiaʹs Central Bank takes no action. Draw the new
aggregate demand and short-run aggregate supply curves in the figure to show the effects of
this event on Atlantiaʹs real GDP and price level.
a) What happens to aggregate supply and aggregate demand?
b) What are the new equilibrium real GDP and price level?
c) Will the rise in the price of oil lead to inflation in Atlantia? Why or why not?
Answer:
a) See the figure above. The increase in the price of oil raises the cost of production and
decreases short-run aggregate supply. The short-run aggregate supply curve shifts
leftward from SAS0  to SAS1 . Aggregate demand is not affected, so the aggregate demand
curve remains at AD 0 .
b) In the short run the economy moves to point C, where real GDP is $200 million and
the price level is 110.
c) The rise in the price of oil results in a one-time rise in the price level, but not ongoing
inflation. A one-time rise in the price level can only be converted into inflation if it is
accompanied by growth in the quantity of money.

4) The figure above shows the initial aggregate demand curve,  AD 0 , the initial short-run
aggregate supply curve, SAS0 , and the long-run aggregate supply curve, LAS. The points in the
figure show possible combinations of real GDP and the price level at which the economy of
Atlantia is in macroeconomic equilibrium. The economy is initially at point  A. Then, Atlantiaʹs
oil producers form a price-fixing organization and increase the price of oil. Suppose that
potential GDP does not change and that Atlantiaʹs Central Bank responds by increasing the
quantity of money. Draw necessary curves in the figure to show the effects of this on Atlantiaʹs
real GDP and price level.
a) In the short run, what happens to aggregate supply and aggregate demand?
b) What are the new short-run equilibrium real GDP and price level?
c) In the long run, if Atlantiaʹs continue to hike the price of oil and the Central Bank continues
to increase the quantity of money, what happens to aggregate supply and aggregate demand?
d) If Atlantiaʹs oil producers continue to hike the price of oil and Atlantiaʹs Central Bank
responds by increasing the quantity of money, what process unfolds?
Answer:
a) See the figure above. The increased price of oil raises the cost of production and
decreases short-run aggregate supply. The short-run aggregate supply curve shifts from
SAS0  to SAS1 . As the Central Bank increases the quantity of money, the interest rate falls,
and aggregate demand increases. The aggregate demand curve rightward shifts from
AD 0  to AD 1 .
b) In the short run, the economy moves to point D, where real GDP is $300 million and
the price level is 115.
c) As the oil producers respond to the higher price level by raising the price of oil,
short-run aggregate supply decreases again and the short-run aggregate supply curve
shifts leftward again, from SAS1  to SAS2 . As the Central Bank increases the quantity of
money again, aggregate demand increases once more and the aggregate demand curve
shifts rightward from AD 1  to AD 2 . The economy moves to point F, where the price level
is even higher. This invites another oil price hike that will call forth yet a further increase
Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education, Inc.Chapter 12   U.S. Inflation, Unemployment, and Business Cycle   385
in the quantity of money. So short-run aggregate supply continues to decrease and
aggregate demand continues to increase.
d) If Atlantiaʹs oil producers continue to hike the price of oil and Atlantiaʹs central bank
continues to increase the quantity of money, a cost-push inflation process unfolds. The
price level rises continuously as the economy moves from point A to point C to point D to
point H to point F and so on.

3) According to tax receipt and outlay categories, what are the main components of the federal
government budget?
Answer: The budget is divided between the tax receipt side and the outlay side. On the taxation
side, the largest components are personal income taxes and social security taxes. Between
them they account for over 80 percent of total government tax receipts. The remainder of
tax revenue comes from corporate income taxes and indirect taxes, such as taxes on items
such as gasoline. On the outlay side, the major three categories are transfer payments, the
expenditure on goods and service, and interest payments on the government debt. The
first category is the largest and continues to grow, accounting for well over half of all
payments. These include payments to individuals, businesses, other levels of
government, and governments around the world. These payments come in the form of
Social Security benefits, unemployment payments, and subsidies, grants and loans to
farmers, local and state governments and foreign governments. The last category, debt
interest, is the smallest and even fell during the late 2000s because the interest rate was
low.

4) Depending on the relative size of the federal governmentʹs outlays and tax receipts, the federal
governmentʹs budget can be in three possible conditions. What are the three possible conditions
and what is the relationship of federal government outlays and tax receipts for each?
Answer: The federal governmentʹs budget could have a budget surplus, a budget deficit, or a
balanced budget. A budget surplus occurs when tax receipts are greater than government
outlays; a deficit occurs when tax receipts are less than government outlays; and a
balanced budget occurs when tax receipts are equal to government outlays.

7) How has the federal government debt as a percentage of GDP changed since the end of World
War II?
Answer: As a percentage of GDP, the federal government debt hit its high at the end of World War
II when it was about 120 percent of GDP. The percentage then fell steadily into the 1970s.
The large deficits of the 1980s raised the percentage during the 1980s and into the 1990s.

8) How does a tax on labor income affect potential GDP?
Answer: The income tax reduces the incentive to work by driving a wedge between gross and net
income. The tax shifts the supply of labor curve leftward and decreases the supply of
labor as workers decide to work fewer hours. The decrease in the supply of labor
decreases the equilibrium level of employment, which decreases potential GDP.

9) What is the Laffer curve? Where on their Laffer curves are the United States, the United
Kingdom and France located?
Answer: The Laffer curve is graphed with tax revenue on the y-axis and tax rates on the x-axis.
The Laffer curve captures the concept that raising the tax rate eventually leads to lower
tax revenues being collected. At low tax rates, an increase in the tax rate raises the total
tax revenue collected. But if government raises the tax rate high enough, an increase in
the tax rate leads to lowers the total tax revenue collected. This effect takes place because
when the tax rate is high enough, the disincentive effect of the tax becomes so large that
enough people give up working and saving so that the total tax revenue declines. While
most economists believe the United States is on the upward sloping part of its Laffer
curve, so that an increase in the tax rate raises total tax revenue. The United Kingdom is
believed to be also on the upward sloping part of its Laffer curve. But France might be at
the peak of its curve or even on the downward sloping part, where an increase in the tax
rate lowers total tax revenue.

10) If the government raises taxes on labor income and interest income, explain how potential GDP
and economic growth are affected.
Answer: Tax increases on labor income decrease the supply of labor and so decrease equilibrium
employment, which decreases potential GDP. Tax increases on the income from capital
decrease saving and so decrease the supply of capital, which decreases equilibrium
investment and capital and so decreases economic growth.

11) What is the difference between discretionary fiscal policy and automatic fiscal policy?
Answer: Discretionary fiscal policy is a policy action initiated by an act of Congress. Automatic
fiscal policy are mechanisms that help stabilize GDP and operate without the need for
explicit action. Both taxes (such as income taxes, whose receipts rise when the economy
expands and fall when the economy contracts) and needs-tested spending (such as
welfare spending, which decreases when the economy expands and increases when the
economy contracts) are examples of automatic fiscal policy.

12) What is automatic fiscal policy? How does it affect the budget deficit and/or budget surplus
during a recession and during an expansion?
Answer: Automatic fiscal policy are features of fiscal policy that stabilize real GDP without the
need for explicit policy action by the government. Automatic fiscal policy includes
automatic changes in taxes and needs-tested spending. The government often sets tax
rates rather than a total dollar amount of taxes. During a recession, taxes receipts
automatically decrease and needs-tested spending increases, so the budget deficit
increases (or the budget surplus decreases). During an expansion, tax receipts
automatically increase and means-tested spending decreases, so the budget deficit
decreases (or the budget surplus increases).

13) What is the government expenditure multiplier?
Answer: The government expenditure multiplier is the magnification effect of a change in
government expenditure on aggregate demand. It exists because an increase in
government expenditure increases aggregate and thereby increases real GDP. In turn the
increase in real GDP induces increases in consumption expenditure which future increase
aggregate expenditure and real GDP. So the ultimate increase in aggregate demand
exceeds the initiating increase in government expenditure.

14) What is needs-tested spending and how does it affect the government expenditure multiplier?
Answer: Needs-tested spending is government spending that changes when GDP changes.
Unemployment compensation payments is an example: They decrease when the
economy expands and increase when the economy contracts. Needs-tested spending
decreases the magnitude of the government expenditure multiplier. For instance, when
government expenditure increases, peopleʹs disposable income increases but
needs-tested spending thereby decreases. The decrease in needs-tested spending offsets
some of the initial increase in disposable income, thereby decreasing the multiplier.

15) Ignoring any supply-side effects, how does the magnitude of the government expenditure
multiplier compare to the magnitude of the tax multiplier? Explain your answer.
Answer: The magnitude of the government expenditure multiplier is larger than the magnitude of
the tax multiplier. The government expenditure multiplier is larger because a $1 change
in government expenditure has an initial effect on aggregate demand of $1. In other
words, a $1 increase in government expenditure initially increases aggregate demand by
the entire $1. However, a $1 change in taxes does  not initially affect aggregate demand by
the entire $1. Instead, it affects aggregate demand by less than $1. For instance, a $1
decrease in taxes increases aggregate demand by less than $1. Why? Because part of the
$1 decrease in taxes is saved and the amount saved does not increase aggregate demand.

Answer: One limitation of fiscal policy is the fact that implementing fiscal policy is slow and so it
is difficult to have the proper policy in place. Another limitation is that at times it is
difficult to determine if GDP is less than, equal to, or greater than potential GDP. As a
result, it is difficult to determine if fiscal policy should be expansionary or contractionary.

3) Does the figure above illustrate a recessionary or an inflationary gap? What do potential GDP
and real GDP equal? What is an appropriate fiscal policy to restore real GDP to potential real
GDP?
Answer: A recessionary gap occurs when real GDP is less than potential GDP, which is precisely
what the figure illustrates. In the figure, potential GDP equals $13 trillion but real GDP
equals only $12.5 trillion. In order to restore real GDP back to potential GDP using fiscal
policy, the government could increase government expenditure on goods and services
and/or decrease taxes.

countryʹs potential GDP?
d) Suppose that Prescottiaʹs government introduces a 25 percent income tax. Using your graph,
what happens to the demand for labor? What happens to the supply of labor? Explain.
e) After the tax is imposed, what happens to Prescottiaʹs full-employment quantity of labor?
What happens to Prescottiaʹs potential GDP?
Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education, Inc.456   Parkin · Macroeconomics, Tenth Edition
Answer:
a)
See the figure above.
b) See the figure above. Prescottiaʹs demand for labor curve is LD and the supply of
labor curve is LS.
c) As shown in the second figure, the labor market is in equilibrium when the quantity
of labor employed is 280 million hours and the real wage rate is $16 per hour. So the
economyʹs full-employment quantity of labor is 280 million hours at a real wage rate of
$16 per hour. Potential GDP is the level of real GDP at full employment. The production
function in the first figure shows that if 280 million hours of labor are employed, the
countryʹs real GDP is $8,400 million. So the economyʹs potential GDP is $8.4 billion.
d) The income tax has no effect on the demand for labor because the quantity of labor
that firms plan to hire depends only on how productive labor is and what it costsits real
wage. But the tax weakens the incentive to work and decreases the supply of labor. When
Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education, Inc.Chapter 13   Fiscal Policy   457
the income tax is imposed, workers look at the after -tax wage rate and, to supply the
same quantity of labor as with no tax, they demand a before-tax wage rate that is 25
percent higher than before. So the supply of labor decreases and the supply of labor curve
shifts from LS to LS T.
e) As shown in the second figure illustrating the labor market, with the tax Prescottiaʹs
full-employment quantity of labor decreases from 280 to 270 million hours per year. And
the production function shown in the first figure illustrates that as the full-employment
quantity of labor decreases from 280 to 270 million hours per year, the economyʹs
potential GDP falls from $8,400 million to (approximately) $8,235 million.

6  Essay Questions
1) Why does the Fed pursue price stability as its ultimate goal?
Answer: The economy works best when the price level is stable and is predictable. Uncertainty
increases if the inflation rate fluctuates unpredictably because these fluctuations increase
the risk to borrowers and lenders and to employers and employees. In both instances,
long-term agreements are made and if inflation differs from what was expected, one
person wins and the other loses. With the lower risk from the lower inflation, more
transactions are conducted, which means more economic activity and more rapid
economic growth.

2) Describe how open market operations change the quantity of money.
Answer: Open market operations affect the quantity of banksʹ reserves. Suppose the Fed buys U.S.
government securities. When the Fed buys government securities, banksʹ reserves
increase. (These reserves rise whether the Fed buys securities from a bank or from a
member of the public.) The rise in banksʹ reserves leads them to increase their lending, so
the quantity of money increases.

6) What is the effect of lowering the interest rate on net exports? Explain your answer.
Answer: A decrease in the interest rate increases net exports. Net exports equals the value of
exports minus the value of imports. Lowering the interest rate makes U.S. securities less
attractive to foreign buyers. As a result, the demand for U.S. dollars decreases because
foreigners no longer need to purchase as many dollars in order to buy U.S. securities. The
decrease in the demand for the U.S. dollar lowers the exchange rate on the foreign
exchange market. The fall in the exchange rate makes U.S. exports less expensive to
foreigners because it now takes less foreign currency to buy a U.S. dollar and hence less
foreign currency to buy U.S. exports. Simultaneously, the price of U.S. imports rises to
U.S. residents. Therefore U.S. exports increase and U.S. imports decrease, both of which
increase net exports.

7) List and briefly explain the steps in how monetary policy affects real GDP in the  AS/AD model.
Tell what is the impact when the Fed eases monetary policy to fight a recession.
Answer: There are several steps. Step one is a change in the federal funds rate. To fight a recession,
the Fed lowers the federal funds rate. It does so by using open market operations to
increase banksʹ reserves. With the increase in reserves, the quantity of money increases,
which then lowers the interest rate. Next the fall in the interest rate increases investment,
net exports (though a fall in the exchange rate), and other interest sensitive parts of
aggregate demand and thereby increases aggregate demand. Aggregate demand
increases with a multiplied effect. The increase in aggregate demand raises the price level
and increases real GDP.

8) Discuss how the Fed raising the federal funds rate ripples through the different sectors of the
economy.
Answer: To raise the federal funds rate, the Fed sells securities in the open market. When the Fed
sells securities in the open market, banksʹ reserves decrease, which raises the federal
funds. In addition, the decrease in reserves decreases the quantity of money. The decrease
in the quantity of money leads to a higher interest rate. A higher interest rate decreases
investment and consumption expenditure, especially consumption expenditure on
durable goods. In the foreign exchange market, the higher interest rate increase the
attractiveness of U.S. securities. Foreigners increase their demand for U.S. dollars in order
to purchase these securities and so the exchange rate of the dollar rises on the foreign
exchange market. The rise in the exchange rate makes exports more expensive to
foreigners and imports less expensive to U.S. residents. As a result, exports decrease and
imports increase so that net exports decrease. All of the changes decrease aggregate
demand.

9) Explain the ripple effects of a sale of securities in an open market operation.
Answer: The Fedʹs actions ripple through the economy. For instance, if the Fed tries to fight a
recession, the Fed lowers the federal funds rate by buying securities in open market
operations. The Fed pays for its purchases of securities by increasing banksʹ reserves,
which lowers the federal funds rate. In addition, the increase in banksʹ reserves increases
the quantity of money. The interest rate falls and thereby consumption expenditure and
investment increase. In addition, the value of the dollar on the foreign exchange market
falls as fewer foreign investors demand dollars to purchase assets in the United States. As
a result, net exports increase. All these changes in expenditure lead to a multiplier effect
that increases aggregate demand, thereby raising the price level and increasing real GDP.

10) Suppose the economy is in recession. Write a letter to the brand -new chairman of the Federal
Reserve suggesting how the Fed might help end the recession. Be sure to explain how a change
in monetary policy will affect economic activity.
Answer: The Fed needs to lower the federal funds rate. It can do so by conducting open market
operations that buy government securities. This action supplies banks with new excess
reserves that result in lowering the federal funds rate and allowing banks to make
additional loans, thereby expanding the quantity of money. When the quantity of money
increases, the interest rate falls. The fall in the interest rate stimulates consumption
expenditure and investment, and also reduce the value of the dollar in foreign exchange
markets, thereby stimulating net exports. These increases in spending will shift the AD
curve rightward and real GDP will increase, although the price level might also rise,
depending on the slope of the SAS curve.

11) In the aggregate demand/aggregate supply framework, lowering the federal funds rate has
what short-run effects on real GDP?
Answer: In the aggregate demand/aggregate supply framework, lowering the federal funds rate
increases the quantity of money and lowers the interest rate, which then increases
aggregate demand. In the short run, the economy moves along its short -run aggregate
supply curve so that the price level rises and real GDP increases.

12) Explain how the Fedʹs response to inflation works its through the economy to ultimately
affecting real GDP and the price level.
Answer: When the Fed is concerned with inflation, the Fed raises the federal funds rate target. To
then boost the federal funds rate up to the new target, the Fed conducts open market
operations that sell government securities. This sale requires that banks and other
purchasers pay for their purchases by using banksʹ reserves, which decreases the amount
of reserves available for banks. The decrease in reserves raises the federal funds rate. It
also decreases the quantity of money. The decrease in the quantity of money shifts the
supply of money curve leftward and the interest rate rises. The higher interest rate leads
to a decrease in the demand for investment and other interest-sensitive sectors of the
economy. These decreases mean that aggregate demand decreases so that the  AD curve
shifts leftward. Following the original decrease in aggregate demand, a multiplier process
begins which decreases aggregate demand even further, so that there is a further leftward
shift of the AD curve. As a result of the decrease in aggregate demand, the price level falls
and real GDP decreases.

13) ʺWhen the Fed is concerned with inflation, it buys government securities.ʺ Is the previous
statement correct or incorrect? Explain your answer.
Answer: The statement is incorrect. When the Fed is concerned with inflation, the Fed wants to
decrease aggregate demand and thereby decrease inflation. In order to decrease
aggregate demand, the Fed needs to raise the federal funds rate. But when the Fed buys
government securities, it lowers the federal funds rate. Therefore the proper Fed policy
when it is concerned about inflation is to sell government securities and thereby raise the
federal funds rate.

14) If the Fed is concerned about inflation, in the short run what is the proper monetary policy to
restore price stability? What actions can the Fed undertake to restore price stability?
Answer: In order to avoid the inflation, the Fed needs to decrease aggregate demand. To decrease
aggregate demand, the Fed must raise the federal funds rate and decrease the quantity of
money. To do so, the Fed will sell government securities, which decreases banksʹ reserves
because the reserves are used to pay the Fed for the government securities. The decrease
in banksʹ reserves raises the federal funds rate and decreases the quantity of money.

15) When would the Fed want to carry out a monetary policy that decreases aggregate demand?
Answer: The Fed wants to decrease aggregate demand when it is worried about inflation. In this
case, real GDP exceeds potential GDP and during the adjustment back to potential GDP,
the price level will rise (so that inflation occurs) as aggregate supply decreases. In this
situation, the Fed might well want to decrease aggregate demand in order to restore the
economy to potential GDP and avoid the rising price level.

16) Explain how the Fedʹs response to a recession works its through the economy to ultimately

Answer: When the Fed is concerned with recession, the Fed lowers the federal funds rate target.
To then lower the federal funds rate to the new target, the Fed conducts open market
operations that buy government securities. The Fed pays for its purchases by increasing
banksʹ reserves. The increase in reserves lowers the federal funds rate. It also increases
the quantity of money. The increase in the quantity of money shifts the supply of money
curve rightward and the interest rate falls. The lower interest rate leads to an increase in
the demand for investment and other interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. These
increases mean that aggregate demand increases so that the  AD curve shifts rightward.
Following the original increase in aggregate demand, a multiplier process begins which
increases aggregate demand even further, so that there is a further rightward shift of the
AD curve. As a result of the increase in aggregate demand, the price level rises and real
GDP increases.

17) In the short run, if the Fed wants to fight a recession, should it buy or sell government
securities? Why?
Answer: The Fed should buy government securities. When the Fed buys government securities,
the federal funds rate falls and banksʹ reserves increase. The increase in reserves increases
the quantity of money and the interest rate falls. As a result, consumption expenditure,
investment, and net exports increase, which increases aggregate demand. The increase in
aggregate demand increases real GDP, which is the policy required when real GDP is less
than potential GDP, that is, when the economy is in a recession.

aggregate demand and increase real GDP? Explain your answer.
Answer: When the economy is in a recession, the Fed wants to increase aggregate demand and
hence GDP, but raising the interest rate is the wrong policy. A boost in the interest rate
decreases consumption expenditure, investment, and net exports and therefore  decreases
aggregate demand. The proper policy for the Fed to pursue is a cut in the interest rate.

8  Extended Problems
1) The figure above shows the demand for money in Kiteland.
a) If the Kiteland Central Bank has set the quantity of money so that the equilibrium interest
rate is 4 percent, draw the supply of money curve.
b) Suppose that Kitelandʹs Central Bank wants to raise the interest rate by 1 percentage point.
By how much must it change the quantity of real money?
c) In order to change the quantity of money to raise the interest rate by one percentage point, if
the Central Bank uses an open market operation, does it make an open market purchase or an
open market sale? Explain your answer.
Answer:
a)
See the figure above. When the supply of money is 250 billion yuks, or  MS 0 , the
Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education, Inc.Chapter 14   Monetary Policy   521
interest rate is 4 percent
b) See the figure above. To raise the interest rate from 4 percent to 5 percent, the Central
Bank decreases the supply of money from 250 billion yuks,  MS 0 , to 150 billion yuks,
MS 1 . So the Central Bank decreases the quantity of real money by 100 billion yuks.
c) The Central Bank conducts an open market sale. As it does so, the bank reserves
decrease, the banks cut their lending until the amount of loans is consistent with the new
level of reserves. As bank loans decrease, the quantity of money decreases.

2) The figure above shows the demand for money in Kiteland.
a) If the Kiteland Central Bank has set the quantity of money so that the equilibrium interest
rate is 4 percent, draw the supply of money curve.
b) Suppose Kitelandʹs real GDP increases so that the demand for money changes by 100 billion
yaks. The Kiteland Central Bank takes no actions. Show the effects of this event on your figure.
What happens to the interest rate? What happens to the quantity of money in the economy?
c) If the Central Bank wants to prevent the interest rate from changing, what must it do to the
quantity of money? Draw the new supply of money curve.
d) In order to change the quantity of money to keep the interest rate constant, suppose the
Kiteland Central Bank uses open market operations. Does it make an open market purchase or
an open market sale? Explain your answer.
Answer:
a)
See the figure above. When the demand for of money is the initial demand,  MD0 , and
the supply of money is MS, 250 billion yuks, then the interest rate is 4 percent.
b) When real GDP increases, the demand for money increases. In this case, the increase
in real GDP increases the demand for money so that the demand for money curve shifts
rightward from MD0  to MD1 . Because the Kiteland Central Bank takes no action, the
quantity of money remains the same, 250 billion yuks, and the supply of money curve
remains MS 0 . With no change in the quantity of money, the increase in the demand for
money raises the interest rate from 4 percent to 5 percent. 
c) To prevent the interest rate from rising, the Kiteland Central Bank increases the
quantity of money from MS 0  to MS 1 .
d) The Kiteland Central Bank makes an open market purchase. As it does so, the bank
reserves increase, the banks increase their lending and so the quantity of money
increases.

3) In the economy of Rulewania, the current inflation rate is 6 percent and the Central Bankʹs target
inflation rate is 2 percent. Real GDP exceeds potential GDP by 1 percent, and the long -term
growth rate of real GDP is 5 percent. The medium-term growth rate of the velocity of
circulation of the monetary base is 2 percent. According to the Taylor rule, what federal funds
rate should the Central Bank set?
Answer: The Taylor rule is to set the federal funds rate equal to 2 percent plus the inflation rate
plus one half of the gap between the actual inflation rate and the target inflation rate plus
one half of the percentage deviation of real GDP from potential GDP. So the federal funds
rate is equal to: 2 percent + 6 percent + 0.5 × 4 percent + 0.5 × 1 percent = 10.5 percent.

5  Essay Questions
1) Define comparative advantage and discuss its role in international trade.
Answer: Comparative advantage is the factor that drives international trade. A country has a
comparative advantage in the production of a good if the country can produce it at a
lower opportunity cost than any other country. Because the cost of production of a good
is lower in the nation with the comparative advantage in the good, that country will
export the good. The country will then gain by buying the goods from other nations that
those nations produce at the lowest opportunity cost, that is, those goods in which the
other nations have a comparative advantage.

when it specializes according to comparative advantage.

3) Why do nations engage in international trade?
Answer: Nations engage in international trade because they gain from trade. International trade
results in a more efficient use of resources and thereby increases world output. As a
result, it increases the amount of goods and services available for consumption in all
nations and thereby makes all countries better off.

4) During 2007, as oil and gas prices continued to increase, a growing number of Americans called
for the United States to become less reliant on Middle-Eastern oil. Would it make sense for the
United States to try to become totally self-reliant in the production of oil? Why or why not?
Answer: It would be foolish for the United States to try to become totally self-reliant in oil
production. There is a reason that approximately 58 percent of our oil comes from OPEC
nations: Middle-Eastern countries can produce oil at a far lower opportunity cost than
U.S. producers. In the Middle East the vast reserves of oil, combined with more lax
regulations imposed by the government, have combined to drive down the per barrel
opportunity cost of oil extraction to very low levels. Hence the United States gains from
trade with these nations. Even though the price of oil in 2007 was higher than it was in
2001, that price was much less than what would be the opportunity cost of producing
enough oil domestically so that the United States was totally self-reliant.

5) Give a brief description of the history of tariffs in the U.S.
Answer: Today, U.S. tariffs are low compared to their historical levels. The average U.S. tariff was
highest in the early 1930s when the Smoot -Hawley tariff was passed. The average tariff
at that time was about 20 percent. Since then there has been a general downward trend so
that today the average tariff is less than 5 percent. The downward trend was fairly rapid
until 1950 and has slowed since then.

6) How does a tariff affect the domestic price of the import, the domestic consumption, the
domestic production, and the quantity imported?
Answer: A tariff raises the price of the good. As a result, domestic consumption decreases as
domestic consumers decrease the quantity they demand. And, also as a result, domestic
production increases as domestic producers increase the quantity they supply. Because
domestic consumption decreases and domestic production increases, the quantity
imported decreases.

8) What are the effects of a tariff?
Answer: A tariff is a tax on goods that are imported into the country imposing the tariff. The tariff
decreases the supply of the imported good, so the tariff raises the domestic price of the
good and decreases the quantity imported. Because the price of the good rises, the
quantity produced in the country imposing the tariff increases.

9) Explain the effects of a quota.
Answer: A quota is a quantitative restriction on the maximum amount of a good that can be
imported. Because quotas limit the supply of the good, they raise the prices of imported
goods and decrease the quantities imported. Unlike a tariff, however, the government
gets no revenue from a quota; the revenue from the higher price goes to importers.

Answer: There are several reasons advanced to restrict trade. These include: the infant -industry
argument (that the nation should protect a young industry that will reap
learning-by-doing gains in productivity and eventually be able to compete successfully
in the world market); dumping (the nation should protect an industry from foreign
competitors who sell goods below cost); protection saves jobs (the claim that imports cost
U.S. jobs); cheap foreign labor (the assertion that tariffs are necessary to compete with
cheap foreign labor); lax environmental standards (the claim that protection is needed to
compete against nations with weak environmental standards); and,  rich nations exploit
developing countries (the suggestion that protection prevents developed nations from
forcing people in poor nations to work for slave wages). Economists reject all of these
claims as valid reasons for protection.

14) Two arguments used to promote trade barriers are the infant-industry argument, and the
dumping argument. Explain each of these arguments and evaluate whether each one has any
flaws.
Answer: The infant-industry argument is that it is necessary to protect a new industry to enable it
to grow into a mature industry that can compete in world markets. The problem with this
argument is that if an industry can eventually compete, then its backers should be willing
to fund it until that time. In addition, if the industry has benefits that spill over to other
industries, then the more efficient government policy is to subsidize the industry rather
than protect it from competition. The dumping argument asserts that protection is
needed to protect domestic industries from foreign dumping practices designed to
eliminate competition. (Dumping is selling a good for a price that is less than its cost of
production.) The problems with this argument are two-fold. First, it is extremely difficult
to determine if a firm is dumping because determining the cost of production is difficult.
Second, even if a firm is dumping, its success in establishing a monopoly is in doubt and
its success in maintaining its global (!) monopoly is even more doubtful. Hence dumping
to obtain a monopoly is likely a very uncommon practice.

Answer: Dumping is the situation in which a firm sells its export goods and services for a lower
price than its cost of production.

16) Because wage rates are so low in Africa, why donʹt Microsoft, Cisco and other major
corporations close down their American operations and move to Africa?
Answer: Wage rates must be weighed against productivity. It is not just wages that influence
where production occurs. Wages divided by the productivity of the workers gives the
average cost of production. In Africa, workers have low levels of skill, education, and
training so their productivity is much less than in the United States. Therefore the cost of
production would be far higher in Africa than in America. So even though U.S. wage
rates are high, industries stay here because the cost of production is lower because U.S.
productivity is so high.

17) Some people assert that protection from foreign competition prevents rich countries from
exploiting developing countries. What is this argument in more detail and what is its flaw?
Answer: The argument claims that rich nations will exploit poor nations by importing goods from
the poor nations and that the workers in the poor nations are paid slave wages to produce
these goods. This argument has a truly fatal flaw. Free trade increases the demand for the
goods produced by workers in developing countries. Thus in order to produce more of
these goods, the firms must hire more workers. Hence the demand for the labor used to
produce the goods increases, which means that the wage rates paid the workers in the
developing countries rises. Thus rather than exploiting the workers in the poor nations,
free international trade is one of their few hopes for better lives!

18) Explain how governments restrict international trade and who benefits as well as who loses
from the restrictions.
Answer: Governments use tariffs and nontariff barriers, such as quotas, to restrict trade. Tariffs
and quotas both boost the domestic price of the protected good. Consumers in that
country lose because of the higher price. The domestic suppliers, however, gain from the
higher price. Tariffs are source of revenue for the government that imposes it on
imported goods, so the domestic government gains from a tariff. Quotas, on the other
hand, do not create revenue for government so the government does not gain from a
quota.

Question history: Previous edition, Chapter 15

19) What is ʺrent seeking?ʺ How does it apply to restricting imports?
Answer: Rent seeking is lobbying and other political activity that seeks to capture the gains from
trade. When imports are restricted, some people gain from the restrictions. Rent seekers,
such as domestic producers of import-competing goods or services, lobby the
government to impose import restrictions because restrictions allow the rent seekers to
gain revenue and/or profit.

20) Economics demonstrates that opening up unrestricted free international trade is beneficial to all
nations. However, are there any losers from such a policy change?
Answer: Yes, there are losers from opening up to free trade. Domestic suppliers of imported goods
lose from allowing free trade. Owners of the businesses lose as do workers who had jobs
in the import-competing industries. However, it is important to realize that although
there are losers from free trade, there also are substantial gains and the gains exceed the
loses so that the nation as a whole is made better off with free trade.

21) How does the United States attempt to compensate losers from lower trade restrictions?
Answer: The U.S. government attempts to compensate workers who lose from lowering U.S. trade
restrictions. For instance, the U.S. government set up a fund to support and retrain
workers who lost their jobs because of NAFTA. Job losers can also collect unemployment
compensation benefits.

3) Suppose that elimination of tariffs on agricultural products means that 1,000 farm workers lose
jobs that pay an average of $20,000 per year. At the same time, because of the importation of
relatively cheaper foreign vegetables, 150 million consumers save $2 per year on their grocery
bills.
a) What is the total income lost by farm workers because of the free trade?
b) What is the total dollar amount saved by all consumers combined?
c) Which is greater, the lost income or the consumer savings? Do the benefits of free trade
out-weigh the costs in this simple example?
d) Which group is most likely to become politically involved over the issue of removing the
tariffs, the farm workers or the consumers? Why?
Answer: a) The total income lost by farm workers is 1,000 × $20,000 = $20,000,000. 
b) The total saving by all consumers is 150,000,000  × $2 = $300,000,000.
c) The consumer savings is much larger than the lost income, so the benefits of free
trade outweigh the costs.
d) The farm workers are more likely to become involved, because their individual loss is
much greater than an individual consumerʹs gain.
