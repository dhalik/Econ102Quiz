      <q>87. Traditionally, the music industry signed multi-year contracts with artists and sold copyright protected music through established distribution channels. A shift to the digital format and the rise of Internet technology has resulted in the sharing of music over peer-to-peer networks, a practice the industry called "piracy." In recent years, the music industry has seen a rapid decline in the number of CDs sold. At the same time, the ownership of the distribution rights of musical content under copyright laws remains clear. Attempts at innovation by individual record labels to offer music as direct downloads to consumer are quickly copied by other labels. Based on these factors, the best assessment is that the music industry has shifted from a  	to a  	cycle market.</q>

He finally received his undergraduate degree from a university with only a post office box for an address. He then enrolled in the school's combined graduate accounting and law school programs, graduating with honor with degrees in both areas. After graduation, he twice failed both the CPA and bar exams, managing to set record low scores on the ethics portions of both. Despite these academic setbacks, Billy's career now seems to be thriving. He has been appointed to a number of "blue ribbon" government committees, is on the board of directors of two corporations and one prestigious not-for-profit organization. In at least one instance, a donor credited Billy with the idea for making a large contribution to the not-for-profit.

Although this company has been highly successful since 1995, Charles has heard persistent rumors of overly aggressive marketing tactics, questionable reporting of sales data, and an atmosphere of intolerance of criticism. The CEO is a powerful and charismatic individual, who built the company from a small regional firm to an international powerhouse in only a decade. The other top managers have been hand-picked by the CEO, as have a number of the members of the board of directors. The salary for this position is very high and includes generous stock options. It would be a major step up in Charles's career and would position him to move to CEO of another company in the future. Charles has prided himself on his high moral values and is viewed as an exceptionally ethical person by his peers. What should Charles do?</q>
      <a>Charles should take the job because he can effect real change in the culture of the organization, and take advantage of the personal financial and career opportunities.</a>
