7  Essay Questions
1) List the four components of aggregate expenditure. Explain the two-way link with real GDP.
Answer: The four components of aggregate expenditure are consumption expenditure,
investment, government expenditure on goods and services, and net exports. These four
components sum to real GDP. The two-way link between these four parts and real GDP
exists through consumption expenditure and imports, both of which are influenced by
the level of real GDP. Specifically, an increase in real GDP increases these components of
aggregate expenditure and an increase in aggregate expenditure increases real GDP.

2) What is the consumption function? What factor leads to a movement along the consumption
function?
Answer: The consumption function is the relationship between disposable income and the amount
of consumption expenditure, other things remaining the same. A change in disposable
income results in a movement along the consumption function.

3) Please explain the relationship between consumption, disposable income and saving.
Answer: In general, the greater the level of disposable income the greater the level of consumption.
Therefore, as disposable income rises consumption rises. Any amount of disposable
income not spent, or consumed, is saved. Disposable income is split between
consumption and saving. Consumption, however, is not solely determined by disposable
income. In fact at low levels of disposable income consumption can be greater than
disposable income. This is true in the extreme when disposable income is zero and
consumption is greater than zero. At times when consumption is greater than disposable
income saving is negative. We are dissaving. On the other hand, if disposable income is
high enough, consumption can be less than disposable income. In this case we have
positive saving. Lastly, as disposable income rises, consumption rises but by less.

4) What is the difference between movements along the consumption function and shifts in the
consumption function? What factor or factors lead to movements along the consumption
function and what factor or factors lead to shifts in the consumption function?
Answer: The consumption function describes the relationship between disposable income and
consumption expenditure: If disposable income increases, consumption increases and if
disposable income decreases consumption decreases. Because the consumption function
is illustrated using disposable income along the horizontal axis, changes in disposable
income lead to movements along the consumption function. Changes in other factors that
affect consumption expenditure, such as the real interest rate, wealth, and expected future
income, shift the consumption function. Specifically, if the real interest rate falls, if wealth
increases, or if future income is expected to increase, the consumption function shifts
upward so that at any level of disposable income, consumption is greater than it
otherwise would have been.

5) List and explain factors that influence consumption expenditure.
Answer: Disposable income is an important factor that influences consumption expenditure. There
is a direct relationship between the two, so that an increase in disposable income leads to
an increase in consumption expenditure. There also are three other factors that influence
consumption expenditure: the real interest rate, the buying power of money, and
expected future disposable income. When the real interest rate falls, the buying power of
money increases, or expected future disposable income increases, consumption increases.
Alternatively, when the real interest rate rises, the buying power of money decreases, or
expected future income decreases, consumption expenditure decreases.

6) How is it possible for consumption expenditure to be positive even when disposable income is
zero?
Answer: Consumption expenditure can be positive when disposable income is zero because
people can ʺdissave,ʺ that is, they can use their past saving to finance current
consumption expenditure. Dissaving cannot occur indefinitely because eventually
peopleʹs savings will be dissipated.

8) What is the marginal propensity to consume? Can the marginal propensity to consume be
greater than 1?
Answer: The marginal propensity to consume is the change in consumption expenditure divided
by the change in disposable income that brought it about. The marginal propensity to
consume cannot be greater than 1. Indeed, it is less than 1 because people save part of an
increase in disposable income.

Answer: Induced expenditure is expenditure that depends on the level of real GDP, so that when
real GDP changes, induced expenditure changes. Autonomous expenditure is
independent of the level of real GDP, so that when real GDP changes, autonomous
expenditure does not change. Consumption expenditure includes elements of both
autonomous and induced expenditure. So, too, do imports. However, investment,
government expenditure on goods and services, and exports are all autonomous
expenditures.

17) Explain the relationships between real GDP, aggregate planned expenditure, induced
expenditure, and unplanned investment.
Answer: All buyers in the economy make expenditure plans. Aggregate planned expenditure
equals the sum of these buying plans. Aggregate planned expenditure is divided into
four components: consumption expenditure, investment, government expenditure on
goods and services, and net exports. Investment, government expenditure, and exports
are autonomous expenditures because they do not vary with the level of real GDP.
Consumption expenditure and imports, however, are affected by the level of real GDP
and so are induced expenditures. If aggregate planned expenditure differs from real
GDP, not all planned expenditure can be carried out. In this situation, firmsʹ inventories
change in an unplanned manner. When aggregate planned expenditure is less that real
GDP, inventories increase beyond what was planned and when aggregate planned
expenditure is greater than real GDP, inventories decrease beyond what was planned.
Because changes in inventories are included in investment, when there are unplanned
changes in inventories there is unplanned investment.

18) At the equilibrium level of aggregate expenditure, what does aggregate planned expenditure
equal? What happens at other levels of real GDP to bring about an equilibrium?
Answer: At the equilibrium level of aggregate expenditure, aggregate planned expenditure is
equal to real GDP. At levels of real GDP where aggregate planned expenditure is greater
than real GDP, business inventories are less than their target levels. In this situation,
businesses increase their production, so output increases and real GDP increases. At
levels of real GDP where aggregate planned expenditure is less than real GDP, business
inventories are greater than their target levels. In this situation, businesses decrease their
production, so output decreases and real GDP decreases.

19) ʺIf aggregate planned expenditure exceeds real GDP, then real GDP will increase.ʺ Explain
whether the previous sentence is correct or incorrect.
Answer: The sentence is correct. If aggregate planned expenditure exceeds real GDP, then firms

increase production in order to restore their inventories back to their planned levels.
When firms increase their production of goods and services, real GDP increases.

20) What is unplanned investment? How does it occur?
Answer: Unplanned investment occurs when inventories grow larger than planned. The difference
between the actual change in inventories and the planned change is unplanned
investment. Unplanned investment occurs when aggregate planned expenditure is less

21) If real GDP exceeds aggregate planned expenditure, what happens to firmʹs unplanned
inventories?
Answer: If real GDP exceeds aggregate planned expenditure, firms are producing more goods and
services than households, firms, and governments are planning to buy. As a result, firms
will not be able to sell all of their production. The unsold amounts will wind up in their
inventories and so unplanned inventory increases.

22) If unplanned inventory changes are positive, what is the relationship between aggregate

GDP.

23) How do firms respond to unplanned inventory changes? What is the effect on their production
and GDP?
Answer: If inventories are above their target levels, that is, more than planned so there is an
unplanned increase in inventories, firms decrease their production. As a result, GDP
decreases. Conversely, if inventories are below their target levels, that is, less than
planned so there is an unplanned decrease in inventories, firms increase their production.
In this case, GDP increases.

24) Explain the relationship between real GDP and aggregate planned expenditure,  AE. What
change to inventories takes place when the two are not equal?
Answer: If the GDP and aggregate planned expenditure are equal, then there is an equilibrium.
But if aggregate planned expenditure is not equal to real GDP, the economy is out of
equilibrium. If aggregate planned expenditure is greater than real GDP, then households,
firms, and governments plan to buy more goods and services than firms are producing.
Firms meet the extra demand by allowing their inventories to decrease. The decrease is
unplanned on the part of firms. So when aggregate planned expenditure exceeds real
GDP, there is an unplanned decrease in inventories. Similarly, if aggregate planned
expenditure is less than real GDP, households, firms, and governments plan to buy less
than firms produce and so there is an unplanned increase in firmsʹ inventories.

26) Suppose that firms find that their inventories are less than planned. In this case, what is the
initial relationship between aggregate planned expenditure and real GDP? Using the aggregate
expenditure model, what adjustments, if any, take place?
Answer: If inventories are less than planned, aggregate planned expenditure exceeds real GDP. In
order to restore their inventories to their desired levels, firms will increase their
production. As a result, real GDP increases. Inventories remain less than planned and real
GDP continues to increase until eventually real GDP reaches its equilibrium level, at
which point actual and planned inventories are equal.

27) How does the economy adjust so that aggregate planned expenditure equals real GDP?
Answer: Equilibrium occurs when real GDP equals the aggregate planned expenditure so that
unplanned inventory change is zero. The unplanned changes to inventory are the key
signal that induces firms to change their production and drive the economy to its
equilibrium. For example, if aggregate planned expenditure is greater than real GDP,
firms find their inventory levels falling. This change is an unplanned reduction so firms
respond by increasing production and, as a result, real GDP and disposable income
increase. The increase in real GDP moves the economy closer to equilibrium but the
increase in disposable income leads to an increase in induced aggregate expenditures.
However the increase in induced aggregate expenditures is less than the increase in real
GDP, so the difference between aggregate planned expenditure and real GDP shrinks. As
long as there is unplanned decreases in inventories, firms continue to increase their

28) A country reports that it has an unplanned inventory increase of $1.0 trillion. Discuss how the
economy adjusts until it reaches an unplanned inventory change of $0.0 trillion.
Answer: When unplanned inventory changes are positive, real GDP exceeds aggregate planned
expenditures. There is an inventory build up, so firms decrease production and as a result
real GDP decreases. Firms continue to decrease production until real GDP equals
aggregate planned expenditures and unplanned inventory changes equal zero.

29) Explain the basic idea of the expenditure multiplier and the role consumers play in determining
its magnitude.
Answer: The basic idea of the multiplier is that any increase in expenditure will increase real GDP
by a larger (a multiple) amount. The magnitude of the multiplier basically depends on
how strongly consumers respond to additional income. Any initial increase in
expenditure increases aggregate expenditure, which leads to more production and an
increase in real GDP and income. Thus an increase, say in investment, generates an
increase in income and this increase, in turn, induces an increase in consumption
expenditure. The second round, the increase in consumption expenditure, is the result of
the first round, the increase in investment. But the story does not stop with just two
rounds. The initial increase in expenditure sets off a chain of increases because the second
round increase in consumption leads to yet another increase in GDP and income. As a
result of this next increase in income, consumption expenditure increases another time
and a third round of expenditure increases occurs. The final result of all the rounds has
real GDP increasing many fold compared to the initial increase in investment.

30) Explain why the multiplier is greater than 1.
Answer: The multiplier is greater than 1 because increases in real GDP induce further increases in
expenditure. For instance, suppose Intel spends $500 million building a new factory. As a
result, the disposable income of the workers constructing the factory increase. With the
increase in their disposable income, these workers increase their consumption
expenditure. Perhaps they all purchase new Ford SUVs. Ford must employ additional
workers to build these SUVs, and so these workersʹ incomes increase. Possibly the Ford
workers all buy new stoves. Hence the initial increase in Intelʹs investment has induced
additional consumption expenditure upon SUVs and stoves. And the process wonʹt stop
with the stoves because the workers who make the stoves will increase their consumption
expenditure. All of the added consumption expenditure makes the multiplier greater
than 1.

35) Explain what happens to equilibrium expenditure if autonomous expenditure increases by $100
million.
Answer: Equilibrium expenditure will increase by more than $100 million because of the
multiplier. Basically, the $100 million increase in spending induces further increases in
aggregate expenditure because the initial increase in expenditure increases income,
which, in turn, causes further increases in expenditure and income.

36) Suppose the MPC = 0.90 and there are no taxes or imports. What dos the multiplier equal? If the
initial equilibrium aggregate expenditure is $12 trillion, what will be the effect on aggregate
expenditure of a $100 billion increase in investment?
Answer: The multiplier equals 1/(1 - MPC), so the multiplier equals 1/(1 - 0.9) = 1/(0.1) = 10. With
a multiplier of 10, a $100 billion increase in investment results in a (10) × ($100 billion) =
$1 trillion increase in aggregate expenditure, so the new equilibrium aggregate
expenditure is $13 trillion.

39) Discuss how the marginal propensity to consume, imports, and income tax rates influence the
multiplier.
Answer: The simple multiplier, in an economy with no imports or income taxes, is 1/(1  - MPC),
where MPC is the marginal propensity to consume. The MPC measures how much
consumption changes when disposable income changes. The larger is the MPC, the larger
is the multiplier. Both the taxes and imports decrease the size of the multiplier because
both taxes and imports ʺdivertʺ changes in GDP from consumption expenditure on
domestic goods and services. The larger the income tax rate and the larger the marginal
propensity to import, the smaller the multiplier. The larger the income tax rate, the
smaller the change in disposable income from any change in GDP and, as a result, the
smaller than induced change in consumption expenditure. The larger the marginal
propensity to import, the more increased consumption expenditure falls on imported
goods and so the smaller the effect on domestically produced goods and services.

40) List and explain factors that determine the size of the multiplier in the aggregate expenditure
model when prices are constant.
Answer: The size of the multiplier depends on three factors: the marginal propensity to consume,
the marginal propensity to import, and the income tax rate. The larger the marginal
propensity to import and the larger the tax rate, the smaller the multiplier. These two
factors decrease the size of the multiplier because imports reduce spending on U.S.
produced products and income taxes reduce the impact of a change in real GDP on
consumption expenditure. On the other hand, the larger the marginal propensity to
consume, the larger the multiplier.

41) How does the concept of the multiplier help explain business cycle turning points?
Answer: Business cycle turning points are the point in the business cycle during which the
economy either goes from expansion to recession, or recession to expansion. If the
economy is at a peak, an expansion is turning into a recession. At this point, aggregate
planned expenditures decrease because of a decrease in an autonomous component of
expenditure. Real GDP is now greater than aggregate planned expenditure. Inventories
rise and firms respond to rising inventories by cutting production, so that real GDP
decreases. The multiplier process works and consumption falls by a multiple of the
decrease in real GDP. The economy moves into recession. Just the reverse occurs at a
trough. At a trough the economy moves from a recession to an expansion. Expansions
start as an increase in an autonomous component of aggregate expenditure. This increase
boosts aggregate planned expenditures so that it exceeds real GDP. Inventories
unexpectedly fall. Firms respond by raising their production, so that real GDP and
disposable income increase. Induced expenditure rises by more because of the multiplier
effect and so the expansion has begun.

42) Discuss the relationship between the business cycle and changes in autonomous expenditures.
Answer: An increase in autonomous expenditure increases aggregate planned expenditure. At the
moment the economy turns the corner into expansion, aggregate planned expenditure
exceeds real GDP. Firmsʹ inventories become less than their target levels, so firms
increase production in order to build up their inventories. The reverse happens when a
recession begins. A decrease in autonomous expenditure decreases aggregate planned
expenditure. When the economy turns the corner into recession, aggregate planned
expenditure is less than real GDP. As a result firmsʹ inventories exceed their target levels,
and so firms decrease production in order to decrease their inventories.

43) ʺWhen the price level increases, aggregate planned expenditure increases and equilibrium
expenditure increases.ʺ Is the preceding statement correct or incorrect? Briefly explain your
answer.
Answer: The statement is incorrect. An increase in the price level decreases aggregate planned
expenditure because the purchasing power of money falls, the real interest rises, and the
price of imports become less expensive relative to domestically produced goods. Because
aggregate planned expenditure decreases, equilibrium expenditure decreases.

45) An increase in the price level shifts the aggregate expenditure curve downward and results in a
movement along the aggregate demand curve. Why does an increase in the price level result in
a shift in the aggregate expenditure curve rather than a movement along it?
Answer: The increase in the price level shifts the aggregate expenditure curve because the
aggregate expenditure curve plots expenditure against real GDP. In other words, the
curve shows how aggregate planned expenditure changes when real GDP changes. Thus
a change in real GDP results in a movement along the aggregate expenditure curve. But
the effect from an increase in the price level creates a shift in the curve because at any
level of real GDP, a higher price level means a lower level of expenditure. Because the
effect of the higher price level applies at all levels of real GDP, the aggregate expenditure
curve shifts downward.

equilibrium expenditure to illustrate how equilibrium expenditure (and hence the

b) government expenditure on goods and services decrease from $2.0 trillion to $1.8 trillion.
c) investment increases from $1.2 trillion to $2.3 trillion.
Answer: a) The change in equilibrium aggregate expenditure equals the multiplier times the

expenditure is 5 × ($0.5 trillion) = $2.5 trillion.
b) The change in equilibrium aggregate expenditure equals the multiplier times the

10  Extended Problems
1) In the country of Midland, autonomous consumption expenditure is $60 million, and the
marginal propensity to consume is 0.6. Investment is $110 million, government expenditure is
$70 million, and there are no income taxes. Investment and government expenditure are
constantthey do not vary with income. The nation does not trade with the rest of the world.
a) Draw the aggregate expenditure curve.
b) What is the autonomous aggregate expenditure?
c) What is the size of the multiplier in Midlandʹs economy?
d) What is aggregate planned expenditure and what is happening to inventories when real
GDP is $800 million?
e) What is the economyʹs equilibrium aggregate expenditure?
Answer:
a) See the figure above. Because the nation does not trade with the rest of the world, net
exports are zero. When net exports are zero, aggregate expenditure, or  AE, is given by
AE = C + I + G. Consumption equals $60 million plus 0.6 of income, so the consumption
function is C = $60 million + 0.6Y, where $60 million is autonomous consumption, 0.60 is
the marginal propensity to consume, and Y is real GDP which equals real income. Using
the formula in the equation for aggregate expenditure gives
AE = $60 million + 0.6Y + $110 million + $70 million, so the formula for aggregate
expenditure is AE = $240 million + 0.6Y.
b) Autonomous expenditure is expenditure that does not vary with real GDP; it is the
amount of aggregate expenditure when real GDP equals zero. In Midland, if  Y = 0,
AE = $240 + 0.6 × 0, so autonomous expenditure is $240 million, shown by point  A in the
figure above.
c) The multiplier is the amount by which a change in autonomous expenditure is
multiplied to determine the change in equilibrium expenditure and real GDP. The
multiplier equals 1/(1 - MPC). So in Midland, the multiplier is 1/(1 - 0.6) = 2.5.
d) When real GDP is $800 million, aggregate planned expenditure, AE, equals
$240 + 0.6 × $800 million, which is $720 million. This level of aggregate planned
expenditure is point B in the figure above. Because this level of aggregate planned
expenditures is less than real GDP, point C in the figure, inventories increase.
Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education, Inc.260   Parkin · Macroeconomics, Tenth Edition
e) Equilibrium expenditure is the level of aggregate expenditure that occurs when
aggregate planned expenditure, AE, equals real GDP. Midlandʹs equilibrium expenditure
is at point E in the figure, when real GDP and aggregate expenditure equal $600 million.
Equilibrium expenditure also can be calculated by solving the equation
Y = $240 million + 0.6Y for Y. Start by subtracting 0.6Y from both sides to give
0.4Y = $240 million. Then divide both sides by 0.4 to obtain Y = $240 million/0.4, so that Y,
which is real GDP, equals $600 million.

expenditure is $100 million, and net taxes are $80 million. Investment, government expenditure,
and taxes are constantthey do not vary with income. The island does not trade with the rest of
the world.
a) Draw the aggregate expenditure curve.
b) What is the islandʹs autonomous aggregate expenditure?
c) What is the size of the multiplier in St. Maynard Islandʹs economy?
d) What is the islandʹs aggregate planned expenditure and what is happening to inventories
when real GDP is $1,100 million?
e) What is the economyʹs equilibrium aggregate expenditure?
Answer:
a) See the figure above. Because the island does not trade with the rest of the world, net
exports are zero. When net exports are zero, aggregate expenditure, or  AE, is given by
AE = C + I + G. Consumption equals $185 million plus 0.75 of disposable income, so the
consumption function is C = $185 million + 0.75(Y - T), where $185 million is
autonomous consumption, 0.75 is the marginal propensity to consume, and  Y - T is
disposable income, real income minus net taxes. (Real income also equals real GDP.)
Because net taxes are constant, the consumption function is
C = $185 million + 0.75(Y - $80 million). Using the formula in the equation for aggregate

expenditure gives AE = $185 million + 0.75(Y - $80 million) + $150 million + $100 million,
so aggregate expenditure is given by AE = $375 million + 0.75Y.
b) Autonomous expenditure is expenditure that does not vary with real GDP; it is the
level of aggregate expenditure if real GDP were equal to zero. In the economy of St.
Maynard Island, if Y = 0, AE = $375 million + 0.75 ( 0, so autonomous expenditure is $375
million, which is point A in the figure above.
c) The multiplier is the amount by which a change in autonomous expenditure is
multiplied to determine the change in equilibrium expenditure and real GDP. The
multiplier equals 1/(1 - slope of AE curve). The slope of the AE curve is 0.75, so in the
economy of St. Maynard Island, the multiplier is 1/(1 - 0.75) = 4.
d) When real GDP is $1,100 million, aggregate planned expenditure,  AE, equals
$375 million + 0.75 × $1,100 million, which is $1,200 million. This level of aggregate
planned expenditure is point B in the figure above. Because this level of aggregate
planned expenditures exceeds real GDP, point C in the figure, inventories decrease.
e) Equilibrium expenditure is the level of aggregate expenditure that occurs when
aggregate planned expenditure, AE, equals real GDP. In the economy of St. Maynard
Island equilibrium is at point E in the figure, when real GDP and aggregate expenditure
equal $1,500 million. Equilibrium expenditure also can be calculated by solving the
equation Y = $375 million + 0.75Y for Y. Start by subtracting 0.75Y from both sides to give
0.25Y  = $375 million. Then divide both sides by 0.25 to obtain  Y = $375 million/0.25, so
that Y, which is real GDP, equals $1,500 million.

3) In the economy of Keynesian Island, autonomous consumption expenditure is $50 million, and
the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8. Investment is $160 million, government expenditure
is $190 million, and net taxes are $250 million. Investment, government purchases, and taxes are
constantthey do not vary with income. The island does not trade with the rest of the world.
a) Draw the aggregate expenditure curve.
b) What is equilibrium real GDP for Keynesian Island?
c) What is the size of the multiplier in Keynesian Islandʹs economy?
d) If the government increases its purchases by $200 million, what will be the change in the
economyʹs equilibrium real GDP?

Answer:
a)
See the figure above. The aggregate expenditure line is AE0. Because the island does
not trade with the rest of the world, net exports are zero. When net exports are zero,
aggregate expenditure, is given by AE = C + I + G. Consumption equals $50 million plus
0.8 of disposable income, so the consumption function is C = $50 million + 0.8(Y - T),
where $50 million is autonomous consumption, 0.8 is the marginal propensity to
consume, and Y - T is disposable income, real income minus net taxes. (Real income also
equals real GDP.) Because net taxes are constant, the consumption function is
C = $50 million + 08(Y - $250 million). Using the formula in the equation for aggregate
expenditure gives AE = $50 million + 0.8(Y - $250 million) + $160 million + $190 million,
so aggregate expenditure is given by AE = $200 million + 0.8Y.
b) Equilibrium expenditure is the level of aggregate expenditure that occurs when
aggregate planned expenditure, AE, equals real GDP. In the economy of Keynesian Island
equilibrium is at point E in the figure, when real GDP and aggregate expenditure equal
$1,000 million. Equilibrium expenditure also can be calculated by solving the equation
Y = $200 million + 0.8Y for Y. Start by subtracting 0.8Y from both sides to give
0.2Y = $200 million. Then divide both sides by 0.2 to obtain Y = $200 million/0.2, so that Y,
which is real GDP, equals $1,000 million.
c) The multiplier is the amount by which a change in autonomous expenditure is
multiplied to determine the change in equilibrium expenditure and real GDP. The
multiplier equals 1/(1 - slope of the AE curve). The slope of the AE curve is 0.80, so in the
economy of Keynesian Island, the multiplier is 1/(1 - 0.8) = 5.
d) If the government increases its expenditure by $200 million, the aggregate
expenditure curve shifts up by the amount of additional purchases to the aggregate
expenditure line AE1 . (The new formula for aggregate expenditure is
AE = $400 million + 0.8Y.) The economyʹs equilibrium real GDP increases by the amount
of the additional expenditure multiplied by the multiplier. So the increase in real GDP is
$200 million × 5, which equals $1,000 million. So the new equilibrium level of real GDP is
$2,000 million, point C in the figure above.
