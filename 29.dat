5  Essay Questions
1) What is demand-pull inflation?
Answer: An inflation that starts from an initial increase in aggregate demand is a demand -pull
inflation.
Topic: Demand-Pull Inflation
Skill: Recognition
Question history: Previous edition, Chapter 12
AACSB: Reflective Thinking
2) What are sources that can start a demand-pull inflation?
Answer: Demand-pull inflation starts with an increase in aggregate demand. This increase can
arise by increases in the quantity of money, increases in government expenditure, or
increases in net exports because any of these three shift increase aggregate demand and
shift the AD curve rightward. The increase in aggregate demand leads to a higher price
level and, temporarily, a higher level of real GDP. If the economy began at full
employment, then temporarily the level of real GDP will be above potential. In the long
run, however, the money wage rate rises to offset the increase in the price level, so the
short-run aggregate supply decreases and the  SAS curve shifts leftward. The decrease in
aggregate supply also raises the price level. So the only way the inflation can continue is
if aggregate demand continues to increase.

3) Describe how a demand-pull inflation can occur.
Answer: Demand-pull inflation starts from an initial increase in aggregate demand. But if this
increase is a one-time only event, the result is a higher price level but not inflation. For
inflation to occur, aggregate demand needs to continue to increase. Continuing increases
in the quantity of money result in continuing increases in aggregate demand, so
monetary growth is necessary for a demand-pull inflation.

4) What was the U.S. experience with demand pull inflation during the 1960s and early 1970s?
Answer: The United States experienced demand pull inflation notably during the late 1960s.
Government spending increased enormously during the decade because of spending on
the Vietnam War and on social programs related to the Great Society of Lyndon Johnson.
These increases in spending were matched by increases in the quantity of money. The  AD
curve shifted rightward, driving prices higher. The decade had begun with inflation of 2
percent per year. By the end of the decade the rate was 5 percent and would reach 10
percent by 1975.

5) What is a cost-push inflation?
Answer: A cost-push inflation is an inflation that starts as a result of an increase in costs. Money
wage rates and the cost of raw materials are the main sources of cost-push inflation.

Question history: Previous edition, Chapter 12
AACSB: Reflective Thinking
6) What factors can start a cost-push inflation? What must the Fedʹs response be for the inflation to
continue?
Answer: Cost push inflation starts with a decrease in the short-run aggregate supply, that is, a
leftward shift of the SAS curve. The decrease in short-run aggregate supply can be the
result of an increase in the money wage rate or an increase in the money price of other
raw materials. In either instance firmsʹ costs have risen and they respond by decreasing
production, which decreases the short-run aggregate supply. The dilemma for the Fed is
that the decreases in short-run aggregate supply means that real GDP falls below
potential GDP and the price level rises. If the Fed responds by increasing the quantity of
money in order to increase aggregate demand and move real GDP back to potential GDP,
the price level will rise still higher. And if the initial agent that raised costs responds to
the higher price level by again raising its costs, then a cost -push inflation might well
occur.

7) What is the Phillips curve? Discuss both the short-run and long-run Phillips curve.
Answer: In general, a Phillips curve shows a relationship between the inflation rate and the
unemployment rate. There is a short-run Phillips curve and a long-run Phillips curve.
Moving along a short-run Phillips curve, expected inflation and the natural
unemployment rate are constant. The short-run Phillips curve shows the relationship
between the inflation rate and unemployment rate: a higher inflation rate results in a
lower unemployment rate. The long-run Phillips curve shows the relationship between
the inflation rate and unemployment rate when the inflation rate equals the expected
inflation rate. Moving along the long-run Phillips curve there is no tradeoff between the
inflation rate and the unemployment rate: a higher inflation rate has no effect on
unemployment rate, which remains equal to the natural unemployment rate.

9) Define and describe the short-run Phillips curve.
Answer: The short-run Phillips curve shows the relationship between the inflation rate and the
unemployment rate when the natural unemployment rate and the expected inflation rate
do not change. The short-run Phillips curve is downward sloping, indicating that there is
a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment: inflation can be lowered only at the cost
of higher unemployment and unemployment can be lowered only at the cost of higher
inflation.

11) What does the short-run Phillips curve indicate about the relationship between inflation and
unemployment?
Answer: Because the slope of the short-run Phillips curve is negative, the short-run Phillips curve
indicates that a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment exists. Lower inflation can
be obtained, but the price is higher unemployment. Similarly, lower unemployment is
possible but the price is higher inflation.

13) If the short-run Phillips curve shifts rightward, what happens to the relationship between
inflation and unemployment? If the short-run Phillips curve shifts leftward, what happens to
the relationship between inflation and unemployment?
Answer: A rightward shift of the short-run Phillips curve worsens the tradeoff between inflation
and unemployment. With the rightward shift, a given level of inflation is now associated
with a higher unemployment rate, or stated another way, a given unemployment rate is
now associated with a higher inflation rate. A leftward shift of the short -run Phillips
curve improves the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. With the leftward
shift, a given level of inflation is now associated with a lower unemployment rate, or
stated another way, a given unemployment rate is now associated with a lower inflation
rate.

14) ʺAs the economy moves upward along its short -run aggregate supply curve, the economy also
moves upward along its short-run Phillips curve.ʺ Is the previous statement correct or
incorrect? Briefly explain your answer.
Answer: The statement is correct. As the economy moves upward along its short-run aggregate
supply curve, the price level rises so that there is inflation. And as the economy moves
upward along its short-run aggregate supply curve, real GDP increases so that the
unemployment rate decreases. So, moving upward along the short -run aggregate supply
curve is associated with inflation and lower unemployment, which is what we see when
we move along the short-run Phillips curve.

15) Discuss the relationship between the short-run aggregate supply curve and the short-run
Phillips curve.
Answer: The short-run Phillips curve and the short-run aggregate supply curve arise because the
money wage rate does not change in the short run. When the price level increases, the
inflation rate is positive. And when the price level increases, the money wage rate does
not change, so the real wage rate declines. As a result of the lower real wage rate, the
quantity of labor employed increases so that the quantity of real GDP increases and the
unemployment rate decreases. Therefore the higher price level is associated with an
increase in real GDP and a higher inflation rate is associated with a decrease in
unemployment.

16) Explain how the expected inflation rate affects the short-run Phillips curve. Be sure to mention
the role played by the money wage rate.
Answer: When the expected inflation rate falls, the short-run Phillips curve shifts downward and
when the expected inflation rate rises, the short-run Phillips curve shifts upward. To see
why the expected inflation rate affects the short-run Phillips curve, the key is that the
expected inflation rate affects the money wage rate. Suppose the expected inflation rate
increases. As a result, labor contracts will now specify higher money wage rates in the
present and in the future. In turn, the higher the money wage rates, the more the
aggregate supply decreases. And, the more the aggregate supply decreases, the lower the
level of employment and the higher the level of unemployment. Therefore for a given
price level and inflation rate, an increase in the expected inflation rate increases the
unemployment rate, which means that the short-run Phillips curve shifts higher.

19) In the long run, what is the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment? Explain your answer
using Phillips curve analysis.
Answer: In the long run, there is no tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. In particular,
in the long run, changes in the inflation rate have no effect on the unemployment rate.
The long-run Phillips curve is vertical, thereby showing that in the long run, any inflation
rate can occur but in the long run the unemployment rate will equal the natural
unemployment rate.

20) Distinguish between the short-run and long-run Phillips curves.
Answer: The long-run Phillips curve shows the relationship between inflation and unemployment
when the unemployment rate equals the natural rate and the inflation rate equals the
expected inflation rate. There is no long-run tradeoff between inflation and
unemployment. The short-run Phillips curve, however, shows the relationship between
the inflation rate and the unemployment rate when the natural unemployment rate and
the expected inflation rate do not change. The short-run Phillips curve is downward
sloping, so that it shows a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.

21) Explain how the short-run and long-run Phillips curves are related.
Answer: The short-run Phillips curve is the relationship between the inflation rate and the
unemployment rate when the natural unemployment rate and the expected inflation rate
remain constant. The long-run Phillips curve is the relationship between the inflation rate
and the unemployment rate when the economy is at full employment. The short-run
Phillips curve is downward sloping, indicating that if the expected inflation rate and
natural unemployment rate do not change, a higher inflation rate decreases the
unemployment rate. The long-run Phillips curve is a vertical line illustrating that in the
long run, the economy at full employment can have any inflation rate. The short -run
Phillips curve intersects the long-run Phillips curve at the expected inflation rate. A
change in the expected inflation rate shifts the short -run Phillips curve but has no effect
on the long-run Phillips curve. An increase in the natural unemployment rate shifts both
the short-run and the long-run Phillips curve.

24) Using the Phillips curves, what are the short-run and long-run effects of a decrease in the
inflation rate?
Answer: In the short run, there is first a downward movement along the short-run Phillips curve
as the inflation rate falls and the unemployment rate increases. In the long run, however,
the expected inflation rate falls and the short-run Phillips curve shifts downward.
Therefore in the long run the inflation rate remains low and the unemployment rate
returns to the natural unemployment rate.

27) Compare and contrast the Keynesian and Monetarist business cycle theories.
Answer: Both theories are centered about changes in aggregate demand as the central cause of the
business cycle. Keynesianʹs use the concept of ʹanimal spiritsʹ and the inability to forecast
the future as the factor that leads to changes in investment. Monetarists assert that
changes in the growth rate of the quantity of money is the factor that leads to business
cycles. As for the adjustment following the initial shock of a change in the level of
investment, both theories envision a multiplier effect. This effect causes a greater change
in aggregate demand (and hence real GDP) than would occur strictly as a result of the
initial change in real GDP. Both theories also believe that sticky wages limit the ability of
the money wage rate to adjust to changes in aggregate demand.

31) What is the impulse that leads to business cycle in the real business cycle, RBC, theory?
Answer: The real business cycle theory focuses on changes in the growth rate of productivity as
the main source of economic fluctuations. Furthermore, the RBC theory views these
changes as random and mainly as a result of changes in the rate of technological change.
It asserts that most of the time technological change is steady, allowing for productivity to
grow at a moderate pace. Occasionally productivity growth speeds up or slows down. If
it speeds up, an expansion can be triggered while if it slows down a recession can result.

32) What is the intertemporal substitution effect and what role does it play in the real business cycle
model?
Answer: The intertemporal substitution effect is the idea that people choose when they will work
by comparing the real wage rate they receive this year to the real wage rate next year,
taking into account the real interest rate. Basically, employees compare how much they
would have earned if they worked this year (and received the real wage rate) and then
saved this amount (and thereby increased the amount by the real interest rate) to the real
interest rate they would earn by working next year. This effect plays a key role in the real
business cycle theory because it means that the supply of labor changes when the real
interest rate changes. For instance, as the economy heads into a recession with investment
demand decreasing, the decrease in investment demand lowers the real interest rate, so
the intertemporal substitution effect decreases the supply of labor and hence
employment. As a result, potential GDP decreases.

33) What are criticisms of the real business cycle theory?
Answer: Four criticisms of the real business cycle theory are frequently made. First is the criticism
that money wage rates are sticky, whereas the real business cycle theory assumes they are
flexible. Second is the assertion that intertemporal substitution is too weak to account for
large fluctuations in employment. Third is the criticism that technology shocks are
implausible as an impulse that causes a business cycle. Fourth is the comment is that
productivity shocks, as measured, are correlated with factors that change aggregate
demand and so are the result of the business cycle not a cause of the business cycle.

34) How do defenders of the real business cycle theory, (RBC theory) respond to critics of the
theory?
Answer: The defenders of the real business cycle theory state that the theory works because it
accurately describes the real-life experiences of both growth and the cyclical nature of
growth. The theory is also consistent with much microeconomic evidence about labor
supply, labor demand and investment demand decisions. They believe that although the
quantity of money is correlated with real GDP, real GDP changes cause the changes in the
quantity of money. Lastly, RBC theory proponents assert that the theory is important
because it points out that business cycles might be a normal state of affairs, which
suggests that government attempts to dampen them are futile.

1) Suppose the natural unemployment rate is 4 percent and the expected inflation rate is 6 percent.
In the above figure, illustrate the long-run Phillips curve. What does the long-run Phillips curve
reveal abut the long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment?
Answer:
The long-run Phillips curve is illustrated in the above figure. It is vertical at the natural
unemployment rate. The fact that the long-run Phillips curve is vertical means that in the
long run there is no tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. In other words, in the
long run higher inflation does not decrease unemployment nor does low inflation
increase unemployment.

8  Extended Problems
1) The figure above shows the initial aggregate demand curve,  AD 0 , the initial short-run
aggregate supply curve, SAS0 , and the long-run aggregate supply curve, LAS. The points in the
figure show possible combinations of real GDP and the price level at which the economy of
Atlantia is in macroeconomic equilibrium. The economy is initially at point  A. Then, the
government increases its expenditure on goods and services. Draw the new aggregate demand
and short-run aggregate supply curves in the figure to show the effects of this event on
Atlantiaʹs real GDP and price level.
a) What happens to Atlantiaʹs potential GDP?
b) In the short run, what happens to aggregate supply and aggregate demand?
c) What are the new short-run equilibrium real GDP and price level?
d) In the long run, what happens to the short-run aggregate supply and aggregate demand?
e) What are the new long-run equilibrium real GDP and price level?
Answer: a) Atlantiaʹs potential GDP is not affected. Potential GDP depends on the economyʹs
factors of production and available technology, not on aggregate spending.

b) See the figure above. The increase in government expenditure increases aggregate
demand. The aggregate demand curve shifts from AD 0  to AD 1 . Because there is no
change in potential GDP and no change in the money wage rate, short run aggregate
supply is not affected. The short-run aggregate supply curve remains at SAS0 .
c) In the short run the economy is at point B, where real GDP is $400 million and the
price level is 105.
d) Because at point B real GDP is above potential GDP, unemployment is less than the
natural rate so the tight conditions in the labor market means that the money wage rate
begins to rise. As it does, short-run aggregate supply decreases. The short-run aggregate
supply curve shifts from SAS0  to SAS1 . Because nothing further affects aggregate
demand, the aggregate demand curve remains at AD 1 .
e) In the long run the economy is at point D, where real GDP is $300 million and the
price level is 115.

2) The figure above shows the initial aggregate demand curve,  AD 0 , the initial short-run
aggregate supply curve, SAS0 , and the long-run aggregate supply curve, LAS. The points in the
figure show possible combinations of real GDP and the price level at which the economy of
Atlantia is in macroeconomic equilibrium. The economy is initially at point  A. Atlantiaʹs Central
Bank then increases the quantity of money year after year. Draw the necessary curves in the
figure to show the effects of this on Atlantiaʹs real GDP and price level.
a) What happens to Atlantiaʹs potential GDP?
b) In the short run, what happens to aggregate supply and aggregate demand?
c) What are the new short-run equilibrium real GDP and price level?
d) In the long run, what happens to aggregate supply and aggregate demand?
e) In the long run, what process is unfolding?

Answer: a) Atlantiaʹs potential GDP is not affected. Potential GDP depends on the economyʹs
factors of production and available technology, not on monetary factors.
b) See the figure above. The increase in the quantity of money lowers the interest rate
and increases aggregate demand. The aggregate demand curve shifts rightward from
AD 0  to AD 1 . Because there is no change in potential GDP and no change in the money
wage rate, the short-run aggregate supply is not affected. The short-run aggregate
supply curve remains at SAS0 .
c) In the short run the economy is at point B, where real GDP is $400 million and the
price level is 105.
d) Because at point B real GDP exceeds potential GDP, unemployment is less than the
natural rate so the tight conditions in the labor market means that the money wage rate
begins to rise. As it does, short-run aggregate supply decreases. The short-run aggregate
supply curve shifts from SAS0  to SAS1 , bringing the economy to point D. But the Central
Bank increases the quantity of money again, and aggregate demand continues to
increase. The aggregate demand curve shifts rightward to AD 2 . The economy moves to
point G, so that the price level rises still more to 120 and real GDP again exceeds potential
GDP at $400 million. The money wage rate rises once again, further decreasing short -run
aggregate supply. The short-run aggregate supply curve shifts from SAS1  to SAS2 ,
bringing the economy to point F. As the quantity of money continues to grow, aggregate
demand continues to increase and short-run aggregate supply continues to decrease.
e) In the long run, the price level rises continuously as the economy moves from point  A
to point B to point D to point G to point F and so on. An ongoing demand-pull inflation
process is the result.

3) The figure above shows the initial aggregate demand curve,  AD 0 , the initial short-run
aggregate supply curve, SAS0 , and the long-run aggregate supply curve, LAS. The points in the
figure show possible combinations of real GDP and the price level at which the economy of
Atlantia is in macroeconomic equilibrium. The economy is initially at point  A. Then, Atlantiaʹs
oil producers form a price-fixing organization and increase the price of oil. Suppose that
potential GDP does not change and that Atlantiaʹs Central Bank takes no action. Draw the new
aggregate demand and short-run aggregate supply curves in the figure to show the effects of
this event on Atlantiaʹs real GDP and price level.
a) What happens to aggregate supply and aggregate demand?
b) What are the new equilibrium real GDP and price level?
c) Will the rise in the price of oil lead to inflation in Atlantia? Why or why not?
Answer:
a) See the figure above. The increase in the price of oil raises the cost of production and
decreases short-run aggregate supply. The short-run aggregate supply curve shifts
leftward from SAS0  to SAS1 . Aggregate demand is not affected, so the aggregate demand
curve remains at AD 0 .
b) In the short run the economy moves to point C, where real GDP is $200 million and
the price level is 110.
c) The rise in the price of oil results in a one-time rise in the price level, but not ongoing
inflation. A one-time rise in the price level can only be converted into inflation if it is
accompanied by growth in the quantity of money.

4) The figure above shows the initial aggregate demand curve,  AD 0 , the initial short-run
aggregate supply curve, SAS0 , and the long-run aggregate supply curve, LAS. The points in the
figure show possible combinations of real GDP and the price level at which the economy of
Atlantia is in macroeconomic equilibrium. The economy is initially at point  A. Then, Atlantiaʹs
oil producers form a price-fixing organization and increase the price of oil. Suppose that
potential GDP does not change and that Atlantiaʹs Central Bank responds by increasing the
quantity of money. Draw necessary curves in the figure to show the effects of this on Atlantiaʹs
real GDP and price level.
a) In the short run, what happens to aggregate supply and aggregate demand?
b) What are the new short-run equilibrium real GDP and price level?
c) In the long run, if Atlantiaʹs continue to hike the price of oil and the Central Bank continues
to increase the quantity of money, what happens to aggregate supply and aggregate demand?
d) If Atlantiaʹs oil producers continue to hike the price of oil and Atlantiaʹs Central Bank
responds by increasing the quantity of money, what process unfolds?
Answer:
a) See the figure above. The increased price of oil raises the cost of production and
decreases short-run aggregate supply. The short-run aggregate supply curve shifts from
SAS0  to SAS1 . As the Central Bank increases the quantity of money, the interest rate falls,
and aggregate demand increases. The aggregate demand curve rightward shifts from
AD 0  to AD 1 .
b) In the short run, the economy moves to point D, where real GDP is $300 million and
the price level is 115.
c) As the oil producers respond to the higher price level by raising the price of oil,
short-run aggregate supply decreases again and the short-run aggregate supply curve
shifts leftward again, from SAS1  to SAS2 . As the Central Bank increases the quantity of
money again, aggregate demand increases once more and the aggregate demand curve
shifts rightward from AD 1  to AD 2 . The economy moves to point F, where the price level
is even higher. This invites another oil price hike that will call forth yet a further increase
Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education, Inc.Chapter 12   U.S. Inflation, Unemployment, and Business Cycle   385
in the quantity of money. So short-run aggregate supply continues to decrease and
aggregate demand continues to increase.
d) If Atlantiaʹs oil producers continue to hike the price of oil and Atlantiaʹs central bank
continues to increase the quantity of money, a cost-push inflation process unfolds. The
price level rises continuously as the economy moves from point A to point C to point D to
point H to point F and so on.
