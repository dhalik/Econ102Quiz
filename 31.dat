6  Essay Questions
1) Why does the Fed pursue price stability as its ultimate goal?
Answer: The economy works best when the price level is stable and is predictable. Uncertainty
increases if the inflation rate fluctuates unpredictably because these fluctuations increase
the risk to borrowers and lenders and to employers and employees. In both instances,
long-term agreements are made and if inflation differs from what was expected, one
person wins and the other loses. With the lower risk from the lower inflation, more
transactions are conducted, which means more economic activity and more rapid
economic growth.

2) Describe how open market operations change the quantity of money.
Answer: Open market operations affect the quantity of banksʹ reserves. Suppose the Fed buys U.S.
government securities. When the Fed buys government securities, banksʹ reserves
increase. (These reserves rise whether the Fed buys securities from a bank or from a
member of the public.) The rise in banksʹ reserves leads them to increase their lending, so
the quantity of money increases.

demanded and supplied are both equal to $2 trillion dollars. If the Fed increases the quantity of
money, what is the effect on the interest rate?
Answer: If the Fed increases the quantity of money, the supply of money curve shifts rightward

5) Assume the Fed is concerned with a possible recession so it wants to lower the interest rate.
How does the Fed lower the interest rate in the short run?
Answer: In order to lower the interest rate, the Fed lowers the federal funds rate by increasing
banksʹ reserves. With the increase in reserves, the quantity of money increases. In the
short run, when the quantity of money increases, the interest rate falls.

6) What is the effect of lowering the interest rate on net exports? Explain your answer.
Answer: A decrease in the interest rate increases net exports. Net exports equals the value of
exports minus the value of imports. Lowering the interest rate makes U.S. securities less
attractive to foreign buyers. As a result, the demand for U.S. dollars decreases because
foreigners no longer need to purchase as many dollars in order to buy U.S. securities. The
decrease in the demand for the U.S. dollar lowers the exchange rate on the foreign
exchange market. The fall in the exchange rate makes U.S. exports less expensive to
foreigners because it now takes less foreign currency to buy a U.S. dollar and hence less
foreign currency to buy U.S. exports. Simultaneously, the price of U.S. imports rises to
U.S. residents. Therefore U.S. exports increase and U.S. imports decrease, both of which
increase net exports.

7) List and briefly explain the steps in how monetary policy affects real GDP in the  AS/AD model.
Tell what is the impact when the Fed eases monetary policy to fight a recession.
Answer: There are several steps. Step one is a change in the federal funds rate. To fight a recession,
the Fed lowers the federal funds rate. It does so by using open market operations to
increase banksʹ reserves. With the increase in reserves, the quantity of money increases,
which then lowers the interest rate. Next the fall in the interest rate increases investment,
net exports (though a fall in the exchange rate), and other interest sensitive parts of
aggregate demand and thereby increases aggregate demand. Aggregate demand
increases with a multiplied effect. The increase in aggregate demand raises the price level
and increases real GDP.

8) Discuss how the Fed raising the federal funds rate ripples through the different sectors of the
economy.
Answer: To raise the federal funds rate, the Fed sells securities in the open market. When the Fed
sells securities in the open market, banksʹ reserves decrease, which raises the federal
funds. In addition, the decrease in reserves decreases the quantity of money. The decrease
in the quantity of money leads to a higher interest rate. A higher interest rate decreases
investment and consumption expenditure, especially consumption expenditure on
durable goods. In the foreign exchange market, the higher interest rate increase the
attractiveness of U.S. securities. Foreigners increase their demand for U.S. dollars in order
to purchase these securities and so the exchange rate of the dollar rises on the foreign
exchange market. The rise in the exchange rate makes exports more expensive to
foreigners and imports less expensive to U.S. residents. As a result, exports decrease and
imports increase so that net exports decrease. All of the changes decrease aggregate
demand.

9) Explain the ripple effects of a sale of securities in an open market operation.
Answer: The Fedʹs actions ripple through the economy. For instance, if the Fed tries to fight a
recession, the Fed lowers the federal funds rate by buying securities in open market
operations. The Fed pays for its purchases of securities by increasing banksʹ reserves,
which lowers the federal funds rate. In addition, the increase in banksʹ reserves increases
the quantity of money. The interest rate falls and thereby consumption expenditure and
investment increase. In addition, the value of the dollar on the foreign exchange market
falls as fewer foreign investors demand dollars to purchase assets in the United States. As
a result, net exports increase. All these changes in expenditure lead to a multiplier effect
that increases aggregate demand, thereby raising the price level and increasing real GDP.

10) Suppose the economy is in recession. Write a letter to the brand -new chairman of the Federal
Reserve suggesting how the Fed might help end the recession. Be sure to explain how a change
in monetary policy will affect economic activity.
Answer: The Fed needs to lower the federal funds rate. It can do so by conducting open market
operations that buy government securities. This action supplies banks with new excess
reserves that result in lowering the federal funds rate and allowing banks to make
additional loans, thereby expanding the quantity of money. When the quantity of money
increases, the interest rate falls. The fall in the interest rate stimulates consumption
expenditure and investment, and also reduce the value of the dollar in foreign exchange
markets, thereby stimulating net exports. These increases in spending will shift the AD
curve rightward and real GDP will increase, although the price level might also rise,
depending on the slope of the SAS curve.

11) In the aggregate demand/aggregate supply framework, lowering the federal funds rate has
what short-run effects on real GDP?
Answer: In the aggregate demand/aggregate supply framework, lowering the federal funds rate
increases the quantity of money and lowers the interest rate, which then increases
aggregate demand. In the short run, the economy moves along its short -run aggregate
supply curve so that the price level rises and real GDP increases.

12) Explain how the Fedʹs response to inflation works its through the economy to ultimately
affecting real GDP and the price level.
Answer: When the Fed is concerned with inflation, the Fed raises the federal funds rate target. To
then boost the federal funds rate up to the new target, the Fed conducts open market
operations that sell government securities. This sale requires that banks and other
purchasers pay for their purchases by using banksʹ reserves, which decreases the amount
of reserves available for banks. The decrease in reserves raises the federal funds rate. It
also decreases the quantity of money. The decrease in the quantity of money shifts the
supply of money curve leftward and the interest rate rises. The higher interest rate leads
to a decrease in the demand for investment and other interest-sensitive sectors of the
economy. These decreases mean that aggregate demand decreases so that the  AD curve
shifts leftward. Following the original decrease in aggregate demand, a multiplier process
begins which decreases aggregate demand even further, so that there is a further leftward
shift of the AD curve. As a result of the decrease in aggregate demand, the price level falls
and real GDP decreases.

13) ʺWhen the Fed is concerned with inflation, it buys government securities.ʺ Is the previous
statement correct or incorrect? Explain your answer.
Answer: The statement is incorrect. When the Fed is concerned with inflation, the Fed wants to
decrease aggregate demand and thereby decrease inflation. In order to decrease
aggregate demand, the Fed needs to raise the federal funds rate. But when the Fed buys
government securities, it lowers the federal funds rate. Therefore the proper Fed policy
when it is concerned about inflation is to sell government securities and thereby raise the
federal funds rate.

14) If the Fed is concerned about inflation, in the short run what is the proper monetary policy to
restore price stability? What actions can the Fed undertake to restore price stability?
Answer: In order to avoid the inflation, the Fed needs to decrease aggregate demand. To decrease
aggregate demand, the Fed must raise the federal funds rate and decrease the quantity of
money. To do so, the Fed will sell government securities, which decreases banksʹ reserves
because the reserves are used to pay the Fed for the government securities. The decrease
in banksʹ reserves raises the federal funds rate and decreases the quantity of money.

15) When would the Fed want to carry out a monetary policy that decreases aggregate demand?
Answer: The Fed wants to decrease aggregate demand when it is worried about inflation. In this
case, real GDP exceeds potential GDP and during the adjustment back to potential GDP,
the price level will rise (so that inflation occurs) as aggregate supply decreases. In this
situation, the Fed might well want to decrease aggregate demand in order to restore the
economy to potential GDP and avoid the rising price level.

16) Explain how the Fedʹs response to a recession works its through the economy to ultimately
affecting real GDP and the price level.
Answer: When the Fed is concerned with recession, the Fed lowers the federal funds rate target.
To then lower the federal funds rate to the new target, the Fed conducts open market
operations that buy government securities. The Fed pays for its purchases by increasing
banksʹ reserves. The increase in reserves lowers the federal funds rate. It also increases
the quantity of money. The increase in the quantity of money shifts the supply of money
curve rightward and the interest rate falls. The lower interest rate leads to an increase in
the demand for investment and other interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. These
increases mean that aggregate demand increases so that the  AD curve shifts rightward.
Following the original increase in aggregate demand, a multiplier process begins which
increases aggregate demand even further, so that there is a further rightward shift of the
AD curve. As a result of the increase in aggregate demand, the price level rises and real
GDP increases.

17) In the short run, if the Fed wants to fight a recession, should it buy or sell government
securities? Why?
Answer: The Fed should buy government securities. When the Fed buys government securities,
the federal funds rate falls and banksʹ reserves increase. The increase in reserves increases
the quantity of money and the interest rate falls. As a result, consumption expenditure,
investment, and net exports increase, which increases aggregate demand. The increase in
aggregate demand increases real GDP, which is the policy required when real GDP is less
than potential GDP, that is, when the economy is in a recession.

18) When the economy is in recession, does the Fed want to raise the interest rate so as to increase
aggregate demand and increase real GDP? Explain your answer.
Answer: When the economy is in a recession, the Fed wants to increase aggregate demand and
hence GDP, but raising the interest rate is the wrong policy. A boost in the interest rate
decreases consumption expenditure, investment, and net exports and therefore  decreases
aggregate demand. The proper policy for the Fed to pursue is a cut in the interest rate.

8  Extended Problems
1) The figure above shows the demand for money in Kiteland.
a) If the Kiteland Central Bank has set the quantity of money so that the equilibrium interest
rate is 4 percent, draw the supply of money curve.
b) Suppose that Kitelandʹs Central Bank wants to raise the interest rate by 1 percentage point.
By how much must it change the quantity of real money?
c) In order to change the quantity of money to raise the interest rate by one percentage point, if
the Central Bank uses an open market operation, does it make an open market purchase or an
open market sale? Explain your answer.
Answer:
a)
See the figure above. When the supply of money is 250 billion yuks, or  MS 0 , the
Copyright © 2012 Pearson Education, Inc.Chapter 14   Monetary Policy   521
interest rate is 4 percent
b) See the figure above. To raise the interest rate from 4 percent to 5 percent, the Central
Bank decreases the supply of money from 250 billion yuks,  MS 0 , to 150 billion yuks,
MS 1 . So the Central Bank decreases the quantity of real money by 100 billion yuks.
c) The Central Bank conducts an open market sale. As it does so, the bank reserves
decrease, the banks cut their lending until the amount of loans is consistent with the new
level of reserves. As bank loans decrease, the quantity of money decreases.

2) The figure above shows the demand for money in Kiteland.
a) If the Kiteland Central Bank has set the quantity of money so that the equilibrium interest
rate is 4 percent, draw the supply of money curve.
b) Suppose Kitelandʹs real GDP increases so that the demand for money changes by 100 billion
yaks. The Kiteland Central Bank takes no actions. Show the effects of this event on your figure.
What happens to the interest rate? What happens to the quantity of money in the economy?
c) If the Central Bank wants to prevent the interest rate from changing, what must it do to the
quantity of money? Draw the new supply of money curve.
d) In order to change the quantity of money to keep the interest rate constant, suppose the
Kiteland Central Bank uses open market operations. Does it make an open market purchase or
an open market sale? Explain your answer.
Answer:
a)
See the figure above. When the demand for of money is the initial demand,  MD0 , and
the supply of money is MS, 250 billion yuks, then the interest rate is 4 percent.
b) When real GDP increases, the demand for money increases. In this case, the increase
in real GDP increases the demand for money so that the demand for money curve shifts
rightward from MD0  to MD1 . Because the Kiteland Central Bank takes no action, the
quantity of money remains the same, 250 billion yuks, and the supply of money curve
remains MS 0 . With no change in the quantity of money, the increase in the demand for
money raises the interest rate from 4 percent to 5 percent. 
c) To prevent the interest rate from rising, the Kiteland Central Bank increases the
quantity of money from MS 0  to MS 1 .
d) The Kiteland Central Bank makes an open market purchase. As it does so, the bank
reserves increase, the banks increase their lending and so the quantity of money
increases.

3) In the economy of Rulewania, the current inflation rate is 6 percent and the Central Bankʹs target
inflation rate is 2 percent. Real GDP exceeds potential GDP by 1 percent, and the long -term
growth rate of real GDP is 5 percent. The medium-term growth rate of the velocity of
circulation of the monetary base is 2 percent. According to the Taylor rule, what federal funds
rate should the Central Bank set?
Answer: The Taylor rule is to set the federal funds rate equal to 2 percent plus the inflation rate
plus one half of the gap between the actual inflation rate and the target inflation rate plus
one half of the percentage deviation of real GDP from potential GDP. So the federal funds
rate is equal to: 2 percent + 6 percent + 0.5 × 4 percent + 0.5 × 1 percent = 10.5 percent.

5  Essay Questions
1) Define comparative advantage and discuss its role in international trade.
Answer: Comparative advantage is the factor that drives international trade. A country has a
comparative advantage in the production of a good if the country can produce it at a
lower opportunity cost than any other country. Because the cost of production of a good
is lower in the nation with the comparative advantage in the good, that country will
export the good. The country will then gain by buying the goods from other nations that
those nations produce at the lowest opportunity cost, that is, those goods in which the
other nations have a comparative advantage.

nations: Middle-Eastern countries can produce oil at a far lower opportunity cost than
U.S. producers. In the Middle East the vast reserves of oil, combined with more lax
regulations imposed by the government, have combined to drive down the per barrel
opportunity cost of oil extraction to very low levels. Hence the United States gains from
trade with these nations. Even though the price of oil in 2007 was higher than it was in
2001, that price was much less than what would be the opportunity cost of producing
enough oil domestically so that the United States was totally self-reliant.

5) Give a brief description of the history of tariffs in the U.S.
Answer: Today, U.S. tariffs are low compared to their historical levels. The average U.S. tariff was
highest in the early 1930s when the Smoot -Hawley tariff was passed. The average tariff
at that time was about 20 percent. Since then there has been a general downward trend so
that today the average tariff is less than 5 percent. The downward trend was fairly rapid
until 1950 and has slowed since then.

6) How does a tariff affect the domestic price of the import, the domestic consumption, the
domestic production, and the quantity imported?
Answer: A tariff raises the price of the good. As a result, domestic consumption decreases as
domestic consumers decrease the quantity they demand. And, also as a result, domestic
production increases as domestic producers increase the quantity they supply. Because
domestic consumption decreases and domestic production increases, the quantity
imported decreases.

8) What are the effects of a tariff?
Answer: A tariff is a tax on goods that are imported into the country imposing the tariff. The tariff
decreases the supply of the imported good, so the tariff raises the domestic price of the
good and decreases the quantity imported. Because the price of the good rises, the
quantity produced in the country imposing the tariff increases.

9) Explain the effects of a quota.
Answer: A quota is a quantitative restriction on the maximum amount of a good that can be
imported. Because quotas limit the supply of the good, they raise the prices of imported
goods and decrease the quantities imported. Unlike a tariff, however, the government
gets no revenue from a quota; the revenue from the higher price goes to importers.

into the United States. What would happen to the price of sugar in the United States if the quota
was removed? What would happen to U.S. consumption and U.S. production of sugar?
Answer: If the quota is removed, the price of sugar in the United States would fall, U.S.
consumption of sugar would increase, and U.S. production of sugar would decrease.

13) Discuss reasons why we see trade restrictions. Are any of these reasons valid?
Answer: There are several reasons advanced to restrict trade. These include: the infant -industry
argument (that the nation should protect a young industry that will reap
learning-by-doing gains in productivity and eventually be able to compete successfully
in the world market); dumping (the nation should protect an industry from foreign
competitors who sell goods below cost); protection saves jobs (the claim that imports cost
U.S. jobs); cheap foreign labor (the assertion that tariffs are necessary to compete with
cheap foreign labor); lax environmental standards (the claim that protection is needed to
compete against nations with weak environmental standards); and,  rich nations exploit
developing countries (the suggestion that protection prevents developed nations from
forcing people in poor nations to work for slave wages). Economists reject all of these
claims as valid reasons for protection.

14) Two arguments used to promote trade barriers are the infant-industry argument, and the
dumping argument. Explain each of these arguments and evaluate whether each one has any
flaws.
Answer: The infant-industry argument is that it is necessary to protect a new industry to enable it
to grow into a mature industry that can compete in world markets. The problem with this
argument is that if an industry can eventually compete, then its backers should be willing
to fund it until that time. In addition, if the industry has benefits that spill over to other
industries, then the more efficient government policy is to subsidize the industry rather
than protect it from competition. The dumping argument asserts that protection is
needed to protect domestic industries from foreign dumping practices designed to
eliminate competition. (Dumping is selling a good for a price that is less than its cost of
production.) The problems with this argument are two-fold. First, it is extremely difficult
to determine if a firm is dumping because determining the cost of production is difficult.
Second, even if a firm is dumping, its success in establishing a monopoly is in doubt and
its success in maintaining its global (!) monopoly is even more doubtful. Hence dumping
to obtain a monopoly is likely a very uncommon practice.

16) Because wage rates are so low in Africa, why donʹt Microsoft, Cisco and other major
corporations close down their American operations and move to Africa?
Answer: Wage rates must be weighed against productivity. It is not just wages that influence
where production occurs. Wages divided by the productivity of the workers gives the
average cost of production. In Africa, workers have low levels of skill, education, and
training so their productivity is much less than in the United States. Therefore the cost of
production would be far higher in Africa than in America. So even though U.S. wage
rates are high, industries stay here because the cost of production is lower because U.S.
productivity is so high.

17) Some people assert that protection from foreign competition prevents rich countries from
exploiting developing countries. What is this argument in more detail and what is its flaw?
Answer: The argument claims that rich nations will exploit poor nations by importing goods from
the poor nations and that the workers in the poor nations are paid slave wages to produce
these goods. This argument has a truly fatal flaw. Free trade increases the demand for the
goods produced by workers in developing countries. Thus in order to produce more of
these goods, the firms must hire more workers. Hence the demand for the labor used to
produce the goods increases, which means that the wage rates paid the workers in the
developing countries rises. Thus rather than exploiting the workers in the poor nations,
free international trade is one of their few hopes for better lives!

18) Explain how governments restrict international trade and who benefits as well as who loses
from the restrictions.
Answer: Governments use tariffs and nontariff barriers, such as quotas, to restrict trade. Tariffs
and quotas both boost the domestic price of the protected good. Consumers in that
country lose because of the higher price. The domestic suppliers, however, gain from the
higher price. Tariffs are source of revenue for the government that imposes it on
imported goods, so the domestic government gains from a tariff. Quotas, on the other
hand, do not create revenue for government so the government does not gain from a
quota.

19) What is ʺrent seeking?ʺ How does it apply to restricting imports?
Answer: Rent seeking is lobbying and other political activity that seeks to capture the gains from
trade. When imports are restricted, some people gain from the restrictions. Rent seekers,
such as domestic producers of import-competing goods or services, lobby the
government to impose import restrictions because restrictions allow the rent seekers to
gain revenue and/or profit.

20) Economics demonstrates that opening up unrestricted free international trade is beneficial to all
nations. However, are there any losers from such a policy change?
Answer: Yes, there are losers from opening up to free trade. Domestic suppliers of imported goods
lose from allowing free trade. Owners of the businesses lose as do workers who had jobs
in the import-competing industries. However, it is important to realize that although
there are losers from free trade, there also are substantial gains and the gains exceed the
loses so that the nation as a whole is made better off with free trade.

workers who lost their jobs because of NAFTA. Job losers can also collect unemployment

3) Suppose that elimination of tariffs on agricultural products means that 1,000 farm workers lose
jobs that pay an average of $20,000 per year. At the same time, because of the importation of
relatively cheaper foreign vegetables, 150 million consumers save $2 per year on their grocery
bills.
a) What is the total income lost by farm workers because of the free trade?
b) What is the total dollar amount saved by all consumers combined?
c) Which is greater, the lost income or the consumer savings? Do the benefits of free trade
out-weigh the costs in this simple example?
d) Which group is most likely to become politically involved over the issue of removing the
tariffs, the farm workers or the consumers? Why?
Answer: a) The total income lost by farm workers is 1,000 × $20,000 = $20,000,000. 
b) The total saving by all consumers is 150,000,000  × $2 = $300,000,000.
c) The consumer savings is much larger than the lost income, so the benefits of free
trade outweigh the costs.
d) The farm workers are more likely to become involved, because their individual loss is
much greater than an individual consumerʹs gain.
